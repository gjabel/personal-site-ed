  <meta property="og:description" content="The possibility of both suspending and propelling a land vehicle completely free of its guideway at a height of 20 to 30 cm represents an entirely new concept in transportation. Resiliently supported by magnetic forces and propelled at speeds up to 500 km/h or greater, a vehicle such as this bears a closer resemblance in both its streamlined shape and behaviour to a wingless aircraft than to the more conventional train riding on wheels along steel rails. Unlike the aircraft, however, from an environmental point of view it is almost noiseless and pollution-free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is only one of several novel modes of land transport using magnetic suspensions and linear Motor propulsion which are being actively developed both here and abroad. These can be roughly divided into (1) the electromagnetic smali-gap suspensions and (2) the electrodynamic large-gap systems. The former is based on the magnetic attraction faces developed between conventional electromagnets on the vehicle and steel guide rails along the track, while the latter so-called magnetic levitation (maglev) system utilises the repulsion forces developed between superconducting coils on the vehicle and induced currents in an aluminium guideway. It is this latter development which is being investigated at the University of Warwick, and, with the help of a grant from the Wolfson Foundation, a linear test facility and a model vehicle is being designed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The essential feature on which the feasibility of this basically simple system depends is the superconducting magnet. These cryogenic magnets are being commercially produced with field strengths many times higher but with weights many times fess than their conventional copper-iron counterparts. Furthermore, since there is virtually no resistance to the flow of current in the superconducting coils, there is negligible power consumption during their operation (mainly the relatively small amounts of refrigeration power required to replenish the supply of liquid helium coolant in the cryostat).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In its simplest form the guideway for the maglev vehicle would be a continuous strip of aluminium conductor having a suitable cross-section to provide both the lift and guidance forces for the vehicle. Analyses of the ride quality of such a maglev vehicle have indicated that the surface roughness of the track need be no better than that of an average motorway. By comparison with small-gap magnetic systems for which accurate and very smooth tracks are essential, the maglev guideway would have considerable advantages both in initial capital costs and in subsequent maintenance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The stringent requirement of maintaining a small air gap between primary and secondary would tend to preclude the use of a linear induction motor drive for the maglev system since this would partially nullify the advantage of the large gap suspension. Apart from the excessive weight of present designs having the primary winding on the vehicle, a major disadvantage of the LIM is the difficulty of power collection in the very-high-speed range up to 500km/h. Most of these drawbacks can be overcome by a linear synchronous motor propulsion system utilising a powered track winding interacting with the superconducting magnets on the vehicle. The possibility of integrating the propulsion and the suspension using the same set of magnets is being investigated. In this paper the basic specifications for a magnetically levitated test vehicle using superconducting magnets and linear synchronous motor propulsion along a powered guideway will be discussed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"><meta property="og:image" content="https://guyabel.com/img/0670_001.png">

    <p class="pub-abstract" itemprop="text">The possibility of both suspending and propelling a land vehicle completely free of its guideway at a height of 20 to 30 cm represents an entirely new concept in transportation. Resiliently supported by magnetic forces and propelled at speeds up to 500 km/h or greater, a vehicle such as this bears a closer resemblance in both its streamlined shape and behaviour to a wingless aircraft than to the more conventional train riding on wheels along steel rails. Unlike the aircraft, however, from an environmental point of view it is almost noiseless and pollution-free.<br><br>This is only one of several novel modes of land transport using magnetic suspensions and linear Motor propulsion which are being actively developed both here and abroad. These can be roughly divided into (1) the electromagnetic smali-gap suspensions and (2) the electrodynamic large-gap systems. The former is based on the magnetic attraction faces developed between conventional electromagnets on the vehicle and steel guide rails along the track, while the latter so-called magnetic levitation (maglev) system utilises the repulsion forces developed between superconducting coils on the vehicle and induced currents in an aluminium guideway. It is this latter development which is being investigated at the University of Warwick, and, with the help of a grant from the Wolfson Foundation, a linear test facility and a model vehicle is being designed.<br><br>The essential feature on which the feasibility of this basically simple system depends is the superconducting magnet.
