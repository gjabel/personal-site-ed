Nuclear Power — nothing to worry about
“A nuclear power plant is infinitely safer than
eating, because 300 people choke to death

on food every year.”
Dixy Lee Ray, 1977
Quoted in G. Barry Golson (ed.) The Playboy Interview (1981).

Why is nuclear power necessary?
¢ From now to 2050, the World’s population will grow
from 6.6 billion to 9 billion
¢ Greenhouse gases will increase by 29 billion tonnes
per year — 900 tonnes per second
¢ Need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by ~60%
globally by 2050; the UK Government is aiming for
an 80% reduction

What is the talk about?
¢ Explain how electricity is produced
¢ Show how nuclear power has contributed
* Look at our future electricity needs and energy security,

compared to other countries
¢ Say how nuclear power in the UK will play a part in a future

balanced energy solution
¢ Describe the options that are being considered by suppliers,

utilities and the Government...

What has Nuclear Power done for us?

¢ We import about 3% of our electricity from France
which comes from their nuclear power stations

¢ Nuclear power is a safe, clean source of energy

¢ Nuclear power has improved the security of
electricity as it does not rely on access to supplies
from volatile or unstable countries

¢ Electricity produced from nuclear power produces
virtually no greenhouse gas emissions; each year,
they prevent 40 million tonnes of CO, being emitted

What has Nuclear Power done for us?

¢ Nuclear fuel will be readily available for centuries

¢ Fossil fuels have been preserved for future
generations

¢ Nuclear power stations can be built as small or
large reactors, to match local needs

¢ Costs are competitive and declining

¢ Waste from nuclear operations has been managed
safely

Security of Supply

¢ Gas contributes about a third to electricity
production

¢ In 2009, half of British gas supplies came from
imports (up from 27% in 2007)

¢ By 2015, gas imports are expected to have risen
to 75% as North Sea supplies run out

What happens in other countries?
¢ There are about 440 reactors operating in 30
countries
¢ Nuclear power generates as much electricity now as
was produced by all sources, globally, in 1960
¢ Two thirds of the world’s population live in countries
where nuclear power reactors are in planning or
under construction
a Research Sites
= Restoration Ltd i

What happens in other countries?
¢ More than 15 countries rely on nuclear for >25% of
their electricity; in Europe and Japan it is >30%,
¢ France and Italy have populations of ~60M.
France is the world’s largest net exporter of
electricity, Italy is the world’s largest importer.
¢ The carbon intensity of electricity generation in
France is 80% lower than in the UK.
¢ China, India, Japan, Korea all have vigorous plans
for increases in nuclear power station construction

How much of our electricity comes
from nuclear power?
¢ In 2006, nuclear plants generated 19% of UK
electricity, compared to 36% from gas, 38% from coal.
¢ In 2007 this dropped to 15% and in 2008 to 13.5%
because of problems with some old plant
¢ With 3% imported from France, UK nuclear electricity
is normally about 22%
°_ Installed capacity is 83GWe, 18GWe retiring soon
a Research Sites
Restoration Ltd 22

How much nuclear power might there
be in the future?
¢ Government policy has proposed the proportion
should stay much the same at about 20%, and is
essential to have any hope in reducing greenhouse
gas emissions to 80% by 2050; this would be about
16GWe of nuclear capacity
¢ Government ministers and advisers have canvassed
40% nuclear as realistic and desirable; this would be
about 30GWe

What are the concerns?
¢ Proliferation: IAEA safeguards all commercial reactors and
breaks the link between civil and military programmes
¢ Operational safety: there are now >13,000 reactor-years of
practical experience; WANO benchmarks operators safety
performance and shares experiences
¢ Waste: low level waste safely stored; interim storage of all
other end products from >50 years of operations; >20,000
containers of high level waste and used fuel moved safely over
20 million miles without instance of serious radioactive release
¢ Terrorism: nuclear plant intrinsically robust and resistant to
external events

Government plans....
¢ Governments appear to have trouble with setting long-term
energy policy but do get there in the end.
¢ 2003 Energy White Paper — “we don’t need new nuclear power,
just renewables and energy efficiency”
¢ 2006 Review of Energy Policy — nuclear back in, but new plants
to be financed and built by private sector
¢ 2007 UK Planning Review — streamlining of approval for major
infrastructure projects
