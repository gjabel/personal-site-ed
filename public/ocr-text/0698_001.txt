ABSTRACT
Flicker in a CRT display can upset the control of saccadic eye movement, even at
frequencies above flicker fusion. The effect decreases with increasing field rate,
therefore operator performance of a demanding visual task may be facilitated by using
a display with a high scan rate. The experiment described here compared the speed and
accuracy with which a visual search task was performed when the display field rate was
50, 80 and 100Hz.

INTRODUCTION
CRT based displays are widespread in remote viewing applications. Most use field
rates in the region of 50 to 75 Hz and will often appear to flicker appreciably.
Flicker can be minimised by careful choice of viewing conditions and display design
[1], however there is evidence that the human visual system responds to _ the
intermittency of illumination even when no flicker is visible. Tyler recorded
electrical activity of the brain synchronous with a display field scan at frequencies
above flicker fusion [2]. Brindley demonstrated the perception of beats between
electrical and visual stimulation of the eye at frequencies where either stimulus
alone would be invisible [3]. It is possible that these responses have undesirable
effects and may be responsible for the commonly reported finding of a slower reading
speed from a CRT than from typescript [4].
Conventional video signals can be converted by digital signal processing to a format
with a higher field rate immediately prior to display [5]. Thus completely flicker-
free viewing can be obtained, circumventing the problems of equipment compatibility.
With the falling cost of digital field storage this will become an economic
proposition in the near future. If there is also an effect on operator performance,
such equipment will be particularly advantageous for surveillance and remote viewing
by television.
Wilkins showed that flicker can cause the enlargement of saccadic eye movements [6].
The extent of the enlargement depends on the display field rate and is evident when
flicker is not noticeable. At 50Hz saccades can be 11% larger than at 100Hz. This may
necessitate corrective saccades, which themselves might be enlarged. A _ practical
implication may be that accurate fixation of the eyes will be facilitated at a high
field rate. A demanding visual search or inspection task, involving many changes of
fixation, will be performed more quickly and possibly more accurately than at a lower
field rate. If the minimum time between saccades is 100msec [7] then every ten
saccades requiring correction will add 1 second to the search time and produce a
measurable difference in performance.
To test this hypothesis, we compared observer performance of a visual search task
using display field rates of 50,80 and 100Hz.
VISUAL SEARCH TASK
Subjects were required to find and count the number of circular targets hidden in a
background pattern of random dots. There were 100 tasks and each contained between 1
and 20 targets. (See figure la for an example.) For each number of targets (1 to 20)
there were five patterns, generated by a microcomputer and stored on disc prior to
the experiment. The disposition of the targets was randomised over the screen, but
evenly distributed between the four quadrants of the screen and none were less than
two targets-widths distant from any other. The resolution of the pattern was 256 by
192 pixels and the targets were drawn in cells 8 by 8 pixels. The background pattern
of random dots had approximately equal numbers of black and white dots and was the
same for all 100 tasks.
APPARATUS
The experiment was controlled and timed by a BBC Master Series microcomputer, which
retrieved the appropriate display pattern from the disc and transferred it as a_ bit-
image, to a display controller, based on an Acorn ATOM. The ATOM had been modified in
several ways and was able to generate video signals at field rates nominally of 50,80
and 100Hz.
The picture was 262 lines, non-interlaced of which 242 lines were active. The display
had a bright border 25 lines wide at the top and bottom, and the equivalent of 58
pixels at either side. This was unavoidable in the graphics mode, but under the
viewing conditions used the border did not flicker noticeably, even at 50 Hz.

250

Two display monitors were used; a BARCO CD351 to display 50 and 80Hz and a MANITRON
VLR20101 for 50 and 100Hz. The BARCO was a colour monitor with a dot-pitch of 0.32mm
and P22 phosphor; the MANITRON a high quality black and white with P4 phosphor. Both
of these are medium-short persistence phosphors [8] and the overall decay waveforms,
when the colour components have been weighted according to the CIE photopic luminous
efficiency curve [9], are very similar for each monitor.
Room Lighting, Viewing Distance and Picture Size
The viewing conditions used were chosen to minimise the visibility of the picture
line structure which was rather coarse, to make the task suitably difficult and the
picture flicker at 50Hz imperceptible.
Room lighting was subdued throughout and entirely from overhead incandescent lamps.
The illuminance falling on a horizontal surface was 170 Lux where the subject was
seated and there were no obvious reflections from the monitor screen; glare was
minimal.
The BARCO was viewed from 160cm and the MANITRON from 150cm. The active picture area
(including the border) subtended 13 by 10 degrees of visual angle, and a target 0.3 by
0.3 degrees. The viewing distances were slightly different so that each monitor
subtended the same visual angle. (See Figure lb.)
Monitor Luminance
Monitor brightness and contrast were matched as accurately as possible, using a_ spot
photometer. The black squares of a chequered test pattern were set (nominally) to 3
Cd/m sq and the white ones to 55 Cd/m sq, giving a contrast ratio of 18.3:1.
Display Resolution
Since the sharpness of the display could affect search times, the resolution was
measured.
The microcomputer was used to generate linear gratings of different spatial
frequencies up to the maximum where alternate pixels along a line were on. As a
measure of system response, the luminance modulation of the display was measured at
each frequency. With a close-up lens attached to the spot photometer it was possible
to measure the luminance of a spot 0.4mm in diameter, so the highest frequency
grating could be encompassed. Modulation is defined as:-
M=(L -L)/(L +L) (1)
W b w b
Where L and L are the luminance of the white bars and black bars respectively.

Ww b
Although modulation was found to fall off slightly at the highest spatial frequency
for field rates of 80 and 100Hz, the difference was not noticeable. Comparing the
measured modulations with modulation sensitivity functions of the human visual system
obtained by Van Meeteren and Vos [8] for a field, 17 by 11 degrees suggests that the
picture degradation would have to be about 200 times greater before the pattern became
invisible.
SUBJECTS
Twelve subjects, aged between 22 and 36 years and naive as to the purpose of the
experiment, participated; there were 10 per sub~experiment and eight were common to
both parts. None were frequent VDU users. Within the last three years each had been
ophthalmically screened and had 6/9 or better visual acuity.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
The experiment was, of necessity, in two parts; the first compared subject performance

251

of the search task at field rates of 50 and 80Hz, using the BARCO monitor, whilst the
second, compared 50 and 100Hz using the MANITRON. It was expected that the two 50Hz
conditions would give a sufficiently similar baseline for the comparison of 80 and
100Hz to be legitimately drawn.
In each sub-experiment the subjects were divided at random into two groups (5 per
group). A subject attended two sessions and completed all 100 search tasks in each.
The first group saw the higher field rate in their first session and the lower rate in
their second, whilst the second group saw the lower field rate first, and the higher
rate second.
The two subjects new to the second part of the experiment were placed in different
groups.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
A session was. started by depressing a key on the microcomputer keyboard. The
instructions were displayed, page by page, on the monitor as black characters on a
bright background. The subjects were instructed to count the targets as quickly and as
accurately as possible. Next, five practise trials were presented for familiarisation,
but from which no data were recorded.
Presentation of the 100 search tasks followed. The order of tasks was always the
same ~ a pseudo-random sequence such that no consecutive tasks had the same number of
targets. A trial commenced with the screen blanked. After about 3 seconds the display
was revealed and the subject began to count the number of targets. When he had an
answer he depressed the keyboard space bar and the screen was again blanked. The
subject entered his answer.
For a correct answer no feedback was given; the screen was cleared and the next task
presented. However, if the answer was incorrect the subject was informed and the task
repeated. A maximum of three attempts was allowed for each task (although the subjects
did not know this) and if the third attempt was still incorrect the experiment
proceeded as if the answer had been correct. The experimenter recorded any erroneous
entries which were nevertheless valid answers (eg. 9 instead of 19).
The computer recorded for each task, the number of attempts taken, the time for which
the task had been displayed and, right or wrong, the subject's answer. At the end of
a session the subject was asked whether he had noticed flicker in the display and for
any comments. After the second session he was also asked which session had been the
. easier and whether he thought that the picture had been any different than before.
RESULTS, ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION
Most of the subjects took about 50 minutes for a session, but the best performers took
30 mins, and the slowest around 75 minutes.
In drawing any conclusions from the comparison of response times it is important to
take into account the error rate (or indeed the response times when considering error
rates). It is possible that subjects trade-off accuracy against a fast performance or
vice-versa and therefore a quantitative comparison of response times where the error
rate does not remain constant can be misleading since two qualitatively different
performances are being compared (slow and accurate versus fast but inaccurate).
Error Rate
The error data were analysed with a two-way analysis of variance of the number of
errors made, with field rate and the number of targets. There was no statistically
significant difference in the total number of errors between any of the field rates
but as expected, the number of targets was significant (F(19,3920)=12.31; p<0.0001).
There was no significant interaction between these two factors. It is therefore
legitimate to compare subject performance by comparing response times. Figure 2 shows
252

the number of errors made for each number of target in part one (50 vs 80Hz with the
BARCO monitor). Similarly figure 3 show the number of errors in the second part.
Response Times
Only the response time for the first attempt at a task has been used. It is possible
that spurious results might have been introduced using the second and third attempts,
where subjects may have reasoned their answer could not have been wrong by more than
one or two and simply adjusted their previous answer.
The response times were examined by regressing mean response time on the number of
targets presented. Linear regression was used for both ad hoc and a priori reasons.
First, because it is a simple model which fitted the data well (typically explaining
about 85% of the variance), and second because response time might reasonably be
expected to vary in an approximately linear way with number of targets presented. For
each trial, there will be a component of response time due to searching the display,
a second due to "registering" each target (to fixate and count a target ) and a_ third
due to pressing the space bar. Whilst it is difficult to know exactly what cognitive
processes are involved with each component, it is reasonable to suppose that the first
and third will be largely independent of the number of targets and that the second
will be related proportionally. The hypothesised effect of picture flicker could
affect either or both of the first two components and hence be manifest as a change of
gradient or both intercept and gradient.
If the residual variance, ie. the variance not explained by the regression, was
significantly reduced by partitioning the data in some way (e.g. by field rate) and
fitting a linear regression, in turn, to the data on each side of the partition, then
these linear regressions would be significantly different.
Figures 4 and 5 show respectively the results for the first and second parts of the
experiment. Each point is the mean of 5 trial by 10 subjects and the error bars are
plus or minus one standard error of the mean.
The following differences were found:-
Monitor Difference p value

BARCO 50Hz vs. BARCO 80Hz _ n.S.

MANITRON 50Hz vs. MANITRON 100Hz 50Hz faster 0.0065

BARCO 50Hz vs. MANITRON 50Hz MANITRON faster <0.0001

BARCO 80Hz vs. MANITRON 100Hz MANITRON faster <0.0001

Table 1.
Regressions of Mean Response Time.
The gradient of the regression for the MANITRON at 50Hz did not differ significantly
from that at 100Hz , whilst the other two significant comparisons differed in slope.
(F(1,1996)=16.11, p=0.0001, and F(1,1996)=8.66, p=0.0033, respectively).
The differences between the regressions are reflected in the overall mean response
times (10 subjects; 100 tasks):-
253

Monitor Mean Response Time (Sec)
+ Standard Deviation
BARCO 50HZ 10.67 + 6.78
BARCO 80Hz 11.09 + 6.45
MANITRON 50Hz 8.89 + 4.58
MANITRON 100Hz 9.45 + 5.07
Table 2
Mean Response Times.
It is evident that the difference between the two field rates of the MANITRON monitor
was quite small and, by comparison with the difference between the two 50Hz
conditions, is probably of no practical consequence.
Possible Effect of Practice
The difference between the two parts of the experiment was unexpected and because of
the experimental design, it is not possible to say whether this is due to physical
differences between the monitors, or can be entirely explained by a practice effect.
Eight of the subjects were common to both parts, and had already completed two
sessions before starting the second part.
(a) Error Rate. For these eight subjects the error rate was not constant across. the
sessions (F(3,3120)=5.13, p=0.001.) A Newman-Keuls analysis showed that for session
4 the rate was no different from session 1, sessions 2 and 3 were not significantly
different from each other but differed from sessions |] and 4. Session 3 and 4 are
respectively, the first and second sessions of part 2.
(b) Response Times. The regressions of mean response time for these eight subjects are
plotted session by session in figure 6. The ordering of the lines is consistent with
a practice effect; the line for each session lies below that of the previous session
and their disposition may well be enough to explain the difference between parts 1 and
2.
Since the error rate changes from session to session a quantitative comparison of the
regressions is dubious, but with practice it might be expected that subjects will
perform more quickly, more accurately, or both at each successive session. For the
first three sessions this was true:- session 2 was faster and more accurate than
session 1; session 3 was faster than session 2 for the same accuracy, but for
session 4 there was a different speed-accuracy trade-off; session 4 was the fastest of
the 4 sessions, but only as accurate as session l.
Session Mean Response Time (sec) No. of Errors
+ Standard Deviation
1 11.93 + 6.79 lll
2 10.33 + 5.88 72
3 9.51 + 4.89 75
4 8.65 + 4.87 107
Table 3
Performance of Subjects Common to both Parts.
This suggests that practice explains the difference between the first three sessions
and probably the difference between the two parts of the experiment, but after three
254

sessions has little further effect.
(c) New Subjects. The two new subjects might be expected to have performed in a
similar way to the ten subjects in part l.
The higher field rate argues that these two subjects performed in a similar manner to
those in part 1, but the lower field rate that they perform like those in part 2, so
no conclusion can be drawn from this. Session by session, they started off slower and
less accurately than the rest in part 2, but by session 2 appear to have performed at
the same speed but more accurately than the other 8. This supports a practice effect,
but these two subjects learnt quickly and appear to have been particularly good at
the task.

Subject Comments

The majority of subjects judged the sessions to be of equal difficulty or that the

second session was easier, regardless of field rate. None spontaneously reported

seeing flicker, and when prompted, only one reported flicker at 50Hz, but still judged
the sessions to be of equal difficulty. There was no evidence that the higher field
rates were preferred.

CONCLUSIONS

The hypothesised effect of display flicker is not confirmed; there is no evidence

under these experimental conditions that subjects performed a demanding visual search

task with increased speed or accuracy at display field rates higher than 50Hz.

It is possible that the effects of flicker reported by Wilkins [6] are only pronounced

for the highly ordered, predictable eye movements used in reading and not the more

erratic ones likely to be found in the search tasks used here.

The difference between the two 50Hz displays is most plausibly explained by a practice

effect rather than any physical characteristics of the monitors. By comparison, the

difference between 50 and 100Hz is small and of little practical consequence.

Although the comparisons were not rigorous, the subjects did not consider any field

rate easier than another and on the whole noticed little difference between any of the

display conditions.

If visible flicker is not a problem, there is probably no advantage to be gained from

using displays with an increased field rate for remote viewing applications.
