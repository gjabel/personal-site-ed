Background to Harwell reactors decommissioning
¢ Harwell has a history of developing innovative reactor
designs - since 1946, 14 reactors have been built and 11
have been decommissioned or moved off-Site
* Our experience of decommissioning and development of
advanced remote handling equipment means that the three
remaining reactors can be completely decommissioned,
whenever funding is available.
¢ Until then, these reactors and their storage blocks
— are defuelled and have undergone Initial Decommissioning
— are sealed and are in safe Care and Maintenance

Initial Decommissioning of the MTRs
¢ MTRs closed for economic, not technical reasons
¢ Majority of work between shutdown in March 1990 to
September 1995
* Office blocks and associated facilities demolished in 1998 —
2002
* Originally the first two of the DIDO fleet of 5 reactors,
worldwide, to close
¢ Now probably will be the last to complete Final
Decommissioning as Denmark, Germany and Australia have
adequately funded decommissioning programmes
Research Sites
The three Stages of decommissioning
(& sub-phases...)
Stage 1 Phase 1 eDefuel & remove D,O
eRemove samples, except cobalt, from rigs
eObtain approval for Safety Justification for Phase 2
Phase 2 eRemove less hazardous secondary systems external to block
eObtain approval for Safety Justification for Phase 3
Phase 3 eRemove remaining Secondary System
eUnload cobalt from rigs
eObtain approval for Safety Justification for Stage 2, Phase 1
Stage 2 Phase 1 eComplete Interim decommissioning & decontamination
eDecommissioning old ventilation systems and install new ones
eObtain approval for Safety Justification for Stage 2, Phase 2
eModify Safety Case, reduce category to Safety Category 3
Phase 2 eExtended Survelliance & Maintenance
Stage 3 eReduction of reactors’ legacy to a delicensed (no harm) state

Final decommissioning of the MTRs
* No technology issues with immediate decommissioning
* Dose levels prevent hands-on dismantling
* Lessons learnt from UKAEA , BNFL as well as DOE
experiences confirm the approaches are valid
¢ Use of COTS equipment with some tailoring and radiation
tolerant designs required
* Immediate decommissioning will generate RH- & CHILW

Present Day Care and Surveillance
* Objective is to keep the MTRs in a stable and prepared state
until Final Decommissioning begins
¢ Prevent unauthorised access
* Ensure corrosion is prevented inside the reactor and D,O
Plant Rooms to minimise particulate discharges
* Keep the Containment Shells in a secure state
* Keep support facilities in Care & Maintenance
¢ Maintain records important to decommissioning in an
accessible Nuclear Knowledge Management system

Advanced Robotics as a new approach
* Existing systems too expensive and complicated
¢ Modified and improved COTS equipment for use in the
nuclear industry up to 10° Gy as commercial products
* Nuclear Engineered Advanced Telerobot (NEATER) — a
autonomous or man-in-the-loop manipulator, based on
industrial robotics, with force feedback, at 10% cost of
contemporary specialist machines
* stereoscopic tv systems (TV?), precisely designed for
continuous periods of use without discomfort
* tools for all decommissioning tasks
* proven capabilities in nuclear and sub-sea environments
