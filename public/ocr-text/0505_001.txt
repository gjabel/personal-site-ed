6. CONCLUSIONS
The development programme has lasted two years
and has resulted in a commercially available
telerobot which can be easily used in a variety
of nuclear applications. The short development
timescale was possible because of the
co-operation of an established robot
manufacturer, and the ability to test, specify
and re-engineer radiation-tolerant components at

Harwell. The use of the prototype machine in

active trials is anticipated within AEA
