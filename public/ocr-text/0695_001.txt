ABSTRACT

The paper refers to work previously described on the development of 3-D Television Systems. 3-D TV

had been developed with a view to proving whether it was a useful remote handling tool which would

be easy to use and comfortable to view. The paper summarizes the work of evaluation trials at UK

facilities and reviews the developments which have subsequently taken place. 3-D TV systems have

been found to give improved performance in terms of speed and accuracy of operations and to reduce

the number of camera views required.

equipment for nuclear decommissioning, part-
