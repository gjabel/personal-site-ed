The Wolfson magnetic levitation project is concerned with the construction of a 500 m long

test track and vehicle, levitated electrodynamically by means of superconducting magnets.

The general design features and present status of the project are described. The particular

aspects which are discussed include the guideway design, the cryogenic system and super-

conducting coils, and both the linear synchronous and commutator motor propulsion

systems having powered track windings.
