Summary.

Trials of the Harwell colour stereoscopic (or three
dimensional) television system are described. A task was based on a
real operation planned as part of decommissioning Windscale’s Advanced
Gas-Cooled Reactor (WAGR); two heavy steel plates were moved between

stands and a plate rack using an overhead gantry crane. The task
required translation, rotation and accurate positioning of the plates.

Operators were timed whilst using 2D or 3D television
viewing systems. For analysis, the task was divided into components.
The one which required accurate alignment of a plate benefited most
from using 3D and was performed 17% faster. The difference was
statistically significant. The data from this component are consistent
with the supposition that 3D is particularly useful in unfamiliar
situations or the initial learning of a task.

Videotapes of two of the operators recorded during the
trials showed that a supplementary 2D view was used differently when
the main view was 3D rather than 2D; with 3D, the operators looked at
the supplementary view for only a small percentage of the time. A
third operator showed a less marked difference, but was thought not to
be typical of those who participated in the experiment.

A questionnaire was completed by 8 operators. Picture
quality of both 2D and 3D was highly rated. All except one had
preferred using the 3D and would have been happy to do so for extended
periods. Most thought that they had performed the task better with 3D
and that a supplementary view was less of a necessity with a 3D main
view.

Two main improvements were suggested by the operators;
that the camera should be fitted with either zoom lenses or a
switchable angle of view, and that clip-on polarising glasses should
be made available for spectacle wearers.

Some of the subjects” comments suggest, in accord with
earlier findings, that the positioning of a single 3D view is far less
critical than the optimal siting of a pair of 2-D views.

1.0 Introduction

This report describes evaluations of the Harwell Colour
Stereoscopic (or 3D) television system at Windscale in December 1987.
Trials were carried out in the HERO vault, a facility designed to
develop and test remote handling equipment and techniques for nuclear
decommissioning, and in particular, the Windscale prototype Advanced
Gas Cooled Reactor (WAGR).

Previously 3D television systems have been evaluated
and compared with conventional two-dimensional (2D) television using
the same facility and similar tasks [1], but the present trials were
perhaps more rigorous, and used a camera and display incorporating the
latest developments and design changes.

Evaluations in a realistic setting are important to
ensure that future development progresses in the right direction; by
allowing potential users access to the equipment useful feedback can
be obtained. Our aim is to design and build a stereoscopic television
system which not only improves operator performance, but is easy to
use and comfortable to view.

In the trials reported here operators were timed
executing a pick-and-place task of heavy steel plates with an overhead
gantry crane. The crane was driven from a control room outside the
vault, with no direct view of the task. It was envisaged that accurate
position of the plates would be facilitated by stereoscopic
television and the task would be completed measurably faster than with
conventional 2D TV views.

When the main view of the task was 3D, it was expected
that a supplementary, 2D view would be little used, but with a 2D main
view it would be much needed. To this end, three of the operators were
videotaped using both 3D and 2D television systems and the percentage
of the time spent looking at each view was assessed.

In addition, all of the operators completed a detailed
questionnaire. They were asked, amongst other things, to rate the
quality of the 2D and 3D pictures, to quantify how much use _ the
supplementary view had been and finally to express a preference.

1.1 The Harwell Stereoscopic Television System

The camera and display are described in detail
elsewhere, [2,3]. Briefly, the camera (see photo. 1) uses two re-
packaged, single-sensor CCD cameras and photographic fixed focal
length lenses. Camera convergence is achieved by axial offset of the
lenses to avoid trapezium distortion associated with camera toe-in.
Camera focus is accurately coupled to the convergence by a mechanical
link. The display (photo. 2) uses two broadcast quality TV monitors,
to enable accurate picture matching. The pictures are optically
combined by a semi-reflective mirror. Polarizing filters, in front of
each monitor and in spectacles worn by the viewer, select the
appropriate image for each eye. Improvements over previous systems
include colour, enhanced resolution, better dynamic range, improved

4

highlight handling, better matching of lens apertures and a more
precise focus and convergence mechanism.
2.0 The Task

The task was based on an operation planned as part of
WAGR decommissioning:- Steel plates dismantled from the pressure
vessel will be transported out of the vessel, ina basket, into a
specially constructed chamber called the Upper Sentencing Cell. Here
they will be removed to a multiple plate rack by a remotely controlled
crane mounted on an overhead slewing beam. In appearance the rack will
be like a giant toast rack and when completely loaded, will be lowered
through a hole in the floor into another chamber, the Lower Sentencing
Cell, where it will be set in concrete for disposal.

The part of this operation mocked-up in the HERO vault
was the transfer of plates to the rack. A full size rack was’ used,
but the distance over which the plates were moved was smaller. The
crane in HERO is mounted on a fixed beam rather than a pivoted one, so
the plates initially rested in specially built stands, each holding a
single plate and placed under the axis of the beam, rather thanin a
basket. Only five of the ten slots in the rack could be reached by the
crane, but the task still involved rotation, translation and accurate
positioning of the plates. Photograph 3 shows the layout and figure l
the floorplan.

Two plates were used, a curved piece of thermal
shielding, 1.54m by 0.61lm and 5 cm thick with a radius of curvature of
about 12m, anda flat plate 1.03m by 0.6m by 8cm thick. These were,
respectively, inserted into slots in the toast rack 8.0 and 8.3cm

~ wide. The plates were always inserted into the same slots in the rack
and returned to the same stands, the slots and stands being identified
by coloured tape wrapped round the neighbouring prongs. The stand for
the curved plate was the further away from the rack and the slot was
the second of the rack. The straight plate was inserted into the fifth
slot of the rack, the furthest away from the stands reached by the
crane. Thus both plates were moved through approximately the same
distance and neither occluded the view of the other to any large
extent during the task. (See fig.1l.)

In the start position both plates were in their stands
and the crane parked at the end of the beam furthest away from them.
Subjects were required to transfer the flat plate to the rack, the
curved plate to the rack and then return, in turn, the plates to their
stands, curved plate first. The sequence was then repeated and finally
the crane returned to the end of it’s beam.

The time taken for each plate transfer, from stand to
rack or vice-versa, was divided into five components:-

Component 1: From start position (or end of component 5) till
first touch of plate with the crane grab.
5

Component 2 : End of component 1 till grab is attached and plate
is lifted clear of a stand or the rack.

Component 3 : End of component 2 till plate first touches
rack or stand.

Component 4 : End of component 3 till plate is inserted fully
home in rack or stand.

Component 5 : End of component 4 till grab is released and
lifed clear of the plate.

2.1 Task Lighting

The Task was lit by quartz-halogen lights, positioned
as shown in figure 1. The key source was a 3.6 kW array of six 600W
lights arranged in three banks and the fill lights were 800W Red
Heads. The lighting was balanced by 3 channels of a 4 channel
dimmer; 2 channels for the Red Heads and a third for one bank of the
key light. The other two banks ran at full power.

No measurements of illuminance were made at the time,
but subsequent measurements in a similar setting suggest that the
plate rack was illuminated with around 6000-7000 Lux.

2.2 Cameras; Positioning and Views of the Task

Two television views of the task were provided - a MAIN
view and a SUPPLEMENTARY view - based on camera positions possible for
the real operation, (although at present only a single view -the MAIN
view -is planned.) The MAIN view was from a height of 1.6m above the
multiple plate rack, more or less square to the slots, and _ the
SUPPLEMENTARY view was from a similar height but displaced to the left
(see Fig.l). The MAIN view was either 2D or 3D, whilst the
SUPPLEMENTARY was always 2D. Both could be panned and tilted through
large angles.

Two cameras mounted on the same pan and tilt head gave
the MAIN view; a Panasonic F10 colour CCD camera for 2D and the
Harwell colour stereo camera for 3D. These were aligned so that their
axes intersected at the centre of the plate rack. Picture quality and
resolution were very similar for the two cameras, since the same type
of sensor is used in both cameras. The SUPPLEMENTARY view, from an
identical F100, and 2D MAIN view were fitted with 12.5 to 75mm zoom
lenses giving an angle of view ranging from 7 to 39 degrees. In 3D,
the MAIN view had a fixed angle of view of 30 degrees. Since the task
subtended an angle of approximately 44 degrees, the whole scene could
not be encompassed in 3D without panning.

The view from the stereoscopic camera, and the
SUPPLEMENTARY view were matched, by eye, for brightness and contrast.
It was not possible to match the 2D MAIN view from the zoom camera as
accurately, -the picture was always slightly darker- but the
a@ifference was small and unlikely to have been of any consequence.

3.0 Viewing Station Layout.

Figure 2 is a plan of the viewing station showing the
placement of television monitors and controls. The operator was seated
directly in front of the stereoscopic display, which was always’. the
MAIN view; a 2D picture could be displayed either by connecting the
same Signal to both monitors and viewing through the polarising
glasses, or by connecting a signal to only one of the monitors and
viewing without glasses. The SUPPLEMENTARY view was displayed on a JVC
14", colour monitor to the left of the operator, angled at about 120
degrees to the screen of the MAIN view.

A video camera was set up above and slightly behind the
SUPPLEMENTARY monitor to enable recording a view of an operator during
the task.

3.1 Crane Controls.

Traversing the crane was controlled by simple on/off
push buttons, whilst raising and lowering the grab used two-stage
buttons; when depressed to the full extent of their travel the faster
of two speeds was selected. Rotation of the grab was controlled by a
rotary switch and although a speed of rotation control was available,
it was preset throughout. The controls acted so that the television
image of the crane moved in the same sense as the controls: i.e.
depressing the left button moved the crane to the left in the picture
and turning the rotary control clockwise rotated the grab clockwise in
the picture.

The grab attached to the crane was opened and closed by
lowering until its weight was supported by the plate and the
suspending cables were slack. This actuated a ratchet mechanism -like
that ina retracting ball point pen- and the grab remained open and
could be lifted clear, or closed as the suspending cables were
tensioned. Thus there were no separate controls for the grab.

3.2 Camera Controls.

Camera pan and tilt were controlled by a_ proportional
joystick for the MAIN view, and by push buttons for the SUPPLEMENTARY
view. To tilt a camera down the joystick was moved forwards, or the
push button furthest away was depressed.

zoom, focus and iris of the 2D views were controlled by
push buttons. For the 3D, iris control was automatic and focus’ was
linked to the convergence control of the camera, a paddle switch. The
convergence control was used to ensure that the object or area of
interest appeared to be in the plane of the screen, giving an optimum
stereo image and best focus. This was most easily achieved by viewing
the display without polarising glasses and adjusting the control until
the appropriate part of the images overlayed. Although the subjects
were free to use the control, in this case it was perfectly acceptable
to leave the convergence at its initial setting, -the centre of the
plate rack.

4.0 Subjects

Eight male subjects aged between 22 and 43 years, with
a median age of 24 years, participated in the trials. All had 6/9 or
better visual acuity, five with spectacle correction, and scored 8/10
or better on the Titmus test of stereo acuity.

Driving the crane was not as simple as the controls
suggest. A particular technique was necessary to avoid setting the
load swinging uncontrollably and colliding violently with equipment
and fixtures in the vault. Therefore all eight of the subjects had
had some instruction and were registered as crane drivers, although
experience varied from half an hour to several hours.

5.0 Experimental Design

Two viewing arrangements were compared:-

(1) 3D MAIN view + 2D SUPPLEMENTARY view.

(2) 2D MAIN view + 2D SUPPLEMENTARY view.

Conditions (1) and (2) are loosely referred to as 3D
and 2D conditions. In condition (1) operators were free to switch the
MAIN view between the stereo camera and the 2D camera if it was
absolutely essential to use a wider angle of view or the zoom
facility. The 2D could be viewed without removing the polarising
glasses. Similarly in condition (2), operators could switch the MAIN
view between the 2D camera and the left eye view from the stereo
camera. By setting the zoom lens to its widest angle of view this
facility could be used to toggle between two angles of view.

Each of the subjects did the task under both viewing
conditions in two sessions, separated by at least three hours. Half
used arrangement (1) first, the others arrangement (2). Three of the
subjects were videotaped under both conditions. Two of these used 2D
first and 3D second, the other 3D first. All subjects answered a
questionnaire after completing both sessions.

5.1 Procedure

At the start of a session the viewing arrangement and
camera controls were explained and the subject was allowed several
minutes to familiarise himself with their operation. For a 3D session
the subject was given the choice of three styles of polarising
spectacles. Where spectacles were already worn to correct deficient
eyesight, the polarising glasses were worn on top of normal
spectacles. In this respect, some styles were more comfortable than
others.

The task was explained and cameras were returned to a
predetermined start position. When it was clear that he understood
the task, the subject was instructed to start.

The experimenter ran a timing program on an IBM PC/AT

8

and entered the start and finish of each component of the task by
depressing a button on the computer mouse. A code was entered after
each plate transfer, so that any components missed by the experimenter
could later be identified. To monitor the subject’s progress, the
experimenter could view a TV monitor connected to the stereo camera
and could see the SUPPLEMENTARY view over the subject “s shoulder. The
times (if any) when the subject switched the MAIN view from the stereo
camera to the 2D camera were also recorded.

In theory, a session ended with the start position restored,
but it was sometimes found that the plate rack or stands had _ been
moved by heavy collision of a plate which had been allowed to swing
excessively. The correct positions were marked by adhesive tape stuck
to the floor and small adjustment were made by manual effort.

After the second session had been completed, the
questionnaire was answered and the ophthalmic tests administered; a
standard letter chart for visual acuity and the Titmus test for stereo
vision.

6.0 Results, Analysis and Discussion

The facility to switch the MAIN view between the stereo
Camera and 2D camera was very seldom used; subjects preferred to pan
or tilt the camera rather than switch to 2D and use the zoom.
Therefore under condition (1) the the MAIN view was considered to be
entirely 3D.

In the following, where t-tests were calculated the
significance levels are for a one-sided test since it was expected, a
priori, that 3D would give the faster times. A one-sided test
addresses the question:- is A faster, or bigger, etc than B? A two-
sided test asks the question:- is A different from B?

6.1 Speed of Performance

Response time or speed of performance is often analysed
in conjunction with the number of, or rate at which errors are made,
since it is possible that accuracy is traded against speed of
performance or vice-versa. In this case it is difficult to say exactly
what constitutes an error. It was inevitable that the plate would
contact the rack or stands during insertion. What magnitude of
collision should be -considered an error ? However any serious
misjudgement of position and subsequent collision set the crane
swinging. The swing needed to be corrected or inserting the plate
became very difficult. Therefore it was assumed that errors or
inaccuracies were reflected in the time taken to complete the task and
performance could be assessed by analysing time alone.

a) Overall Time.

The variability between subjects was considerable; with

3D MAIN view, the longest time taken to complete the session was 2278

seconds and the shortest 1097 seconds. With 2D the time ranged from
9

1279 to 2594 seconds. The result of a paired t-test (ie subjects 2D
time minus 3D time) was not significant (t=1.42, d.f=7, p=0.099)
although the mean 2D-3D difference was 141 seconds.

b) Component Times.

Unfortunately, it was not possible to recover most of
the data for the 3D session of one subject. Therefore he was not
included in the following analysis. In order to keep the experiment

balanced and easily analysed, a second subject had to be dropped. The
first had used the 3D viewing arrangement first session, so the other
subject had to be one of those who had used 2D first. Rather than pick
at random, the subject we chose not to include had considerably more
experience of driving the crane and using conventional 2D television
than the rest. The following is therefore based on data from 6
operators, and although there were some missing values where the
experimenter failed to record the start or finish of a component, the
experiment remains reasonably balanced.

If it is assumed that the two plates were of equal
difficulty to move and that the directions, from stand to toast rack
and from rack to stand, were equivalent, then each component was
repeated eight times per session. For each repetition of each of the 5
components for each subject, the time taken with 3D was subtracted
from the corresponding 2D time. This reduces the variability and
allows for a more precise testing of statistical significance.

The mean time difference (2D-3D time) for each
component could be tested for significance with a t-test. However this
assumes a normal distribution of the data and normal probability plots
revealed that the assumption did not hold for components 3 and 4. (See
appendix 1.) This is important because these were the components most
likely to have been affected by the choice of viewing system and a
rigorous test is highly desirable.

It could be argued that accurate alignment of a plate
will sometimes have been largely achieved before the first touch of
the rack or stand, and sometimes afterwards. In the former case the
plate could rapidly be inserted into the rack soon after the first
touch, whilst in the latter case more time would elapse between first
touch and the plate being fully inserted: there would be a negative
linear correlation between the times for components 3 and 4. The
correlation coefficient of the 2D-3D times for these components was
calculated to be -0.31, which is statistically significant. (d.f.= 46,
p < 0.025 one sided.) Therefore a better definition of components
would be to combine components 3 and 4 in a single component which
always included alignment of the plate. This component, termed
component X, wasS calculated simply by adding the times for components
3 and 4. The distribution of the difference, 2D minus corresponding
3D time is now approximately normal. (See appendix 1.)

The correlation matrix of component 2D-3D times (see
appendix 2.) indicates that there are _ two other Significant
correlations; between components 1 and 5, (r = 0.42 d.f = 46, p <
0.005) and between components X and 2 (r = -0.37, d.f = 46, p <

10

0.025). There is no intuitive reason why these components should be
correlated, other than that they are repeated measures of subject ‘s
performance. However the main interest here is the difference between
3D and 2D, no strong claims are made about the differences between
components, so they have been regarded as independent.

The mean 2D-3D component times are shown in figure 3.
Table 1 gives the results of t-testing the hypothesis that these mean
time differences are greater than zero.

Note that “Total” is the mean of the sum of components
rather than the sum of the component means. Since there were missing
values and the component means were not based on the same number of
observations, these will not necessarily be the same.

Mean Component Times

Component X was the part of the task which required the

most positional accuracy and showed the most benefit from using 3D; an
ll

improvement of 17%.
c) Serial Order Effects.

Previously we have hypothesised that stereoscopic
television is particularly useful in viewing unfamiliar situations
[1]. Here it might be expected that differences between 2D and 3D will
be most pronounced in the early repetitions of the first session.

However the cross-over nature of the experimental
design does not allow a very precise comparison; considering the first
session alone there would only be three subjects per viewing
condition. Perhaps because of the large individual differences, the
mean 2D and 3D times for each repetition do not show any recognisable
trend.

There may also be another difficulty: any such effect
could be confounded with periodic effects arising from violations of
the assumptions (a) that the plates were of equal difficulty to move
and (b) that the directions were equivalent (see section 6.1 b). For
instance, if the curved plate was considerably more difficult to move
than the straight plate, the mean time for every other repetition
would be increased. If both assumptions were violated the periodic
pattern would be quite complex.

For component X, which showed the largest percentage
2D-3D difference, a two-way analysis of variance revealed that the
directions were distinct; moving a plate to the rack took longer than
returning it to a stand (F(1,89) = 17.1, p < 0.001). However there was
no statistically significant difference between the plates and no
plate-direction interaction. The analysis of variance table is given
in appendix 3 (table A3.1). There was no interaction between direction
and viewing system and therfore no need to qualify the conclusions
Graw in the previous section (i.e using 3D facilitated moving plates
both to and from the rack). Table 3 gives the mean times for each
Girection under 2D and 3D viewing conditions.

3D Mean Time 2D Mean Time
+ Standard Error + Standard Error
Stand to Rack 125.4 + 15.8 158.7 + 16.4
Rack to Stand 82.7 + 7.8 94.3 + 9.8
Table 3.
Mean Time (Seconds) for Component X for Direction and View
Adjusting component xX for direction, a further
analysis of variance showed that the effect of repetition was
statistically significant (F(7,71) = 2.29, p = 0.04, table A3.2), but
the difference between sessions was not. Note that the analysis took
into account the expectation that for each subject, performance in
12

session 1 would be correlated with performance in session 2, but not
necessarily with that of any other subject in either session [4]. It
was also found there was no interaction between session and
repetition. Therefore the two sessions can be pooled and the 2D-3D
times used. Precision is improved, data from all six subjects are used
and the periodic effects of direction are intrinsically removed.
Figure 4 shows mean 2D-3D time for each repetition of component X.
Calculating the linear regression of 2D-3D time on
repetition showed that there was no linear trend; the slope was not
significantly different from 0 (F(1,44) = 0.88, p = 0.35, table A3.3).
However a curve of the form:-
Time = a + b * Exp(-c * repetition)
with the parameters a = 9.4, b = 443, c= 1.9, fitted the data
somewhat better. This is the curve drawn in figure 4. The trend is not
Statistically significant (F(2,43 = 2.04), p= 0.12, table A3.4),
unless the same curve is fitted to the mean 2D-3D time for each
repetition (F(2,5) = 14, p< 0.01, table A3.5, whereas linear
regression is not significant:- F(1,6) = 1.76, p= 0.23 ), but does
suggest two things. First that the principle difference between 2D and
3D is to be found in the first two repetitions and second, that
thereafter the 2D-3D time is asymptotic to some small positive value;
for this component performance will always be slightly better with 3D
viewing.
6.2 Videotaped Subjects
Videotapes of two of the operators recorded during the
trials showed that the SUPPLEMENTARY view was used differently when
the MAIN view was 3D rather than 2D; with 3D the operators looked at
the SUPPLEMENTARY view for only a small percentage of the time. (See
table 4.) A third operator was videotaped but showed a less marked
difference between 2D and 3D. However he was perhaps not typical and
had more experience of using orthogonal, 2D viewing systems,
preferring to use a way of working which was familiar and ignoring the
depth information provided by the 3D.

The sample is too small for any reliable statistics,
but does strongly suggests that the depth infomation provided by the
3D view made the SUPPLEMENTARY view largely unnecessary for this task.
There is also no evidence to suggest that these operators found the 3D
system uncomfortable to watch; they did not frequently have to look
away or peer into the display.

6.3 Questionnaire Results

All eight subjects answered the questionnaire; the text
is given in appendix 4. The following summarises the main findings:-

a) Picture quality of both 2D and 3D views was rated
highly. On a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 equals excellent, both had a
median score of 9.

b) All except one subject thought that he performed the
task either slightly better or very much better when the MAIN view was
3D. The exception found no difference. However, slightly at odds with
this, on a scale of 1 to 10 (l10=extremely difficult) the median score
for task difficulty was 4 for 3D and 5 with 2D - only a_e small
difference.

c) In concordance with the videotapes, the
SUPPLEMENTARY view was used differently with 3D and 2D MAIN views. On
a scale of 1to10, where 1 = no use at all and 10 = absolutely
essential, the median rating with 3D was 3 and with 2D, 8.

ad) With one exception, the subjects would have been
happy to use the 3D system for extended periods. With 2D there were
two exceptions.

e) The most difficult aspect of the task was driving
the crane in a way which minimised swing of the load. This required
a fair degree of skill, but was independent of viewing system. Two out
of the eight thought that joystick controls would improve matters.

f£) Seven out of the eight subjects thought that the
display monitors for MAIN and SUPPLEMENTARY view could have been
better positioned; closer together, particularly for 2D. Despite this,
they thought that the effect on performance was slight or that there
was no effect at all. However closer placing of the monitors would
have made the videotapes difficult to analyse.

g) Finally, two subjects very much preferred using the
3D, five slightly preferred 3D and one slightly preferred 2D.

The subject in g) who preferred using 2D viewing was
the exception in d) who would not have been happy to use 3D for
extended periods. He was also the subject in b) who did not think he
performed the task better with 3D viewing, and the third of those
video taped. This lends support to the contention in the previous
section that he was atypical.

14

A number of comments were made by more than 1 subject:-

a) A wider angle of view, a choice of angles or a zoom
would be desirable for the stereoscopic camera. (4 subjects).

b) 3D was preferred because it gives a better spatial
sense. (4 subjects).

c) For 2D viewing plan and elevation views would have
been preferred. (2 subjects).

ad) For those who normally wear spectacles, a clip-on
polarising viewer, like clip-on sunglasses, might be more comfortable
than wearing two pairs of spectacles. (2 Subjects).

7.0 Conclusions

The use of Stereoscopic television gave a worthwhile
and statistically significant improvement in operator performance for
part of the task. This was the one which required most positional
accuracy, and with 3D the mean time was 17% faster. Considering the
slow speed at which the crane moved and the relative clumsSiness of the
controls this is a fairly large margin. For a more dextrous task we
expect this margin to be even wider.

It was not possible to demonstrate conclusively that 3D
was particularly useful in an unfamiliar situation or during the
initial learning phase, but the results are consistent with this
supposition. With hindsight, such an effect would have to be very
pronounced to be apparent from an experiment of the design used here.

The videotapes recorded during the trials suggest that
for this task a single 3D view is almost entirely sufficient, and in
addition, that the operators had no difficulty in using it. The use of
stereoscopic television for the real operation is recommended.

Answers to the questionnaire and subject comments
proved that the stereoscopic system was well liked and comfortable to
view. In addition, support was given to the analysis of the
videotapes; operators thought that the SUPPLEMENTARY view was of less
use when the MAIN view was 3D rather then 2D. There is also the
suggestion that perhaps 3D camera positioning is less critical than
with conventional 2D views.

Two main improvements were suggested; that the camera
should have a zoom lens, or switchable angle of view, and that some
clip-on polarising glasses should be made available.

Notes on Correlation
1) The correlation coefficient between two variable x and y is’ given
by:- er)
le
r= 1 Dom By F)
N Sx Sy 7
Where:-
N is the number of observations of x and y,
Sx and Sy are respectively the standard
deviations of x and y,
xX and y are the means of x and y.

2) The maximum value of r is +l and the minimum -l. A correlation of
+1 indicates a perfect, linear functional relationship between x
and y where increasing x is associated with increasing y. A value
of -1 indicates a perfect functional relationship where
increasing x is associated with decreasing y.

3) A correlation of 0 indicates that there is no linear relationship
between x and y; they are uncorrelated.

4) Intermediate values of r indicate a trend rather than a_ strictly
functional relationship. The larger the modulus of fr, the
stronger the trend. Positive values indicate that increasing x is
associated with increasing y, whilst negative values indicate
the association of increasing x with decreasing y.

Notes on Analysis of Variance for Table A3.2.

1) The times for each Repetition of component X were corrected for
Direction by subtracting the appropriate Direction mean.

2) The factors Repetition and Session are repeated measures. They are
within-subject factors, and likewise their interaction. Since
repetition has the same meaning at each level of session, the
factors are crossed.

3) For the correct analysis the mean squares should be compared with
the within-subject residual. Hence the first line of table A3.2
gives the between-subject sum of squares and the required residual
sum of squares can be calculated by subtraction.
