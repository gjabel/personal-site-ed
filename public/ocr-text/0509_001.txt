ABSTRACT

This paper describes the development of a new 6-axis general
purpose Hand Controller called the Cartesian mini Master Arm
(CmMA). It provides end-point bilateral control in remote
manipulative operations. Though the device is primarily intended
for use with the NEATER Robot, thus making it a true Telerobot,
it can also be used with many other remote handling systems
including Hydraulic Servo Manipulators and other industrial
robots. Emphasis is placed on the optimisation of the end point

‘ bilateral control since the majority of the critical tasks that have to
be performed remotely involve the control of manipulator end
effector interaction with the object and/or environment. The
paper also deals with the rationale used to determine the master
arm kinematics, dynamics and control. The principles of
operation and control have been tested in simulation and through
construction of a mechanism breadboard. A prototype unit will be
operational by the end of 1990.

INTRODUCTION

The increased need for remote control operations in the Nuclear Industry has
long been recognised, particularly with the beginning of large scale
decommissioning and waste management operations of old active facilities and
power stations. AEA Technology's philosophy is to adapt proven industrial
standards and products wherever possible to meet the general remote handling
requirements. As a result, the PUMA 760 Robot has been mechanically
upgraded to provide decontaminability, ease of maintenance and tolerance to
radioactive environments. The result is NEATER, the Nuclear Engineered
Advanced Telerobot.

Even though some routine tasks in a nuclear environment can be carried out
robotically by the upgraded robot, the majority of the tasks in operations such as
decommissioning are complex and impossible to plan in advance. These tasks
therefore demand the incorporation of human judgement, skill and sensory

interaction to perform them successfully and safely. The sensory information
required by the operator during remote manipulation includes vision, hearing and
feel. Advanced telerobotic control therefore requires the development of a
suitable input device to command the position and orientation of the remote end
effector required by the operator and to feed back the resulting forces exerted on
the robot by its environment. The term master arm has traditionally been used to
describe a device which gives an operator this direct control over manipulative
tasks, and this terminology will be retained. Though the geometry envisaged
here is significantly different from that of the traditional manipulator master arm.

The kinematics and dynamics of a master arm basically determine the
manoeuvrability of the remote manipulator system [1]. The range of motions in
the joints and links and their mechanical properties greatly influence its ease of
use and dexterity. The mechanical input impedance characterised by inertia,
viscous drag, friction and compliance of the device must be made as low as
possible for the operator so that the task forces become transparent. Several
different kinematic schemes were studied from a variety of viewpoints but the
overall objective was to maximize the dexterity in the wrist. Several master arm
designs seeking high dexterity for operators have been proposed and developed
by many researchers, for example, polar co-ordinate type by Bejczy & Salisbury

, [2], vertically articulated (anthropomorphic) type by Kuban et al [3], horizontally
articulated type (SCARA) by Hirai & Sato [4] and cartesian co-ordinate type by
Matsuhira et al [5], Jacobus et al [6] and many others. It was necessary to find
some basis for choosing between these various types.

It must be noted that the relative position of the master arm to the operator is
also an important factor as well as the design of the master arm itself. A good
master arm must be easily displaceable over a reasonable range of travel and
must not restrict the operator's bodily freedom at his chosen workplace
(depending on the application, this may be seated at a desk or standing at a
viewing window). Since several kinematic arrangements can meet this objective,
other requirements for its use were also closely examined to choose the
kinematics for the master arm. One such additional need within Harwell was a
bilateral command input device which could control either NEATER or the
Harwell Hydraulic servo manipulator [7]. It was therefore decided to use a
general purpose master arm configuration so that it could be employed with
many different types of slave robot or manipulator. The most obvious open
kinematic scheme to use is a cartesian co-ordinate frame, which can either be
fixed to the end point or in the base of a robot or manipulator. Another
advantage of the cartesian kinematic arrangement is that almost all robot
controllers can accept external cartesian commands from other peripherals (such
as teach pendants, joysticks, etc) over a serial digital communication link for the
trajectory control. This will therefore facilitate the use of the already developed
inverse kinematic software with singularity control of various robots with little or
no modification. Communications can still be a bottleneck and may require
improvements in speed for better manual control with force feedback.

KINEMATICS OF THE CARTESIAN MINI MASTER ARM

On the basis of these considerations, the CARTESIAN mini MASTER ARM
(CmMA) now under development at Harwell is a desk-top command input device
with bilateral characteristics for use in teleoperation. The motions of the CnMA
generated by the human operator are read by the Tele-Robotic Controller (TRC)
and are scaled, transformed and conditioned as desired to control the robot in
either world or tool coordinate frames. Different modes of control such as
resolved rate, resolved position and resolved force/torque can be selected at will
to perform a remote task conveniently and safely. The wrist, which issues
orientation commands, has been designed to provide a one-to-one kinematic
correspondence with minimum of inertia, friction and backlash using
conventional cable-driven transmissions used in servomanipulators. The parallel
linkage scheme was utilized to form a base capable of providing motions in the X
and Y directions for a column providing the Z or up/down motion. It was also
felt that the X-Y-Z motions of the mechanism must exhibit homogeneous
mechanical properties - inertia, friction and stiffness, as far as possible. This has
therefore demanded symmetry in the mechanism. The overall mechanism is
gravitationally balanced and provision has been made to measure the forces in the
X,Y and Z directions so that the excessive inertial resistances in these motions

: can be compensated for by using feedforward control of the motors. This paper
describes the features of this Master arm and its control.

A cartesian kinematic structure can be realised by a variety of linkage
arrangements. Fundamentally, there are two possibilities: one using a serial
linkage scheme and the other using a parallel linkage scheme. Figure 1 shows
the use of a serial linkage scheme for the X-Y motions while figure 2 shows a
parallel linkage scheme for the X-Y motions. It can be seen that the parallel
linkage scheme is capable of exhibiting homogeneous mechanical properties and
provide a uniform structure through which the forces will be transmitted to the
origin of the cartesian co-ordinate frame of the master arm. The structure is
basically an inverted pendulum in 2-dimensions that requires some form of
balancing to prevent it from collapsing. Several schemes based on both active
and passive balancing methods were investigated.

The wrist mechanism has been synthesized from the orthogonally pivoted
rings or gimbal structure (Fig 3) widely used in gyroscope instruments instead of
using the conventional differential wrist gear mechanism. The handle itself,
which can be twisted, provides the yaw motion and can be configured for either a
seated operator or a standing operator, (Fig 4). The inner gimbal, which has
been simplified as a straight bridge for ease of manufacture, enables the
generation of pitch command motions while the outer gimbal provides the wrist
roll command motions. The motors used for force feedback actuation in these
wrist motions have been located remotely to reduce the cumulative inertia as the
wrist mechanism is a serially linked structure. Cables are used for the
transmission of the mechanical power between the motors and the final wrist

motions. Newly available cable chains which exhibit low friction and no
backlash were considered but were not chosen because of the constraints on
available space and their relatively low stiffness when compared with cables.

The remote location of the motors facilitates the construction of a wrist
mechanism with mutually orthogonal motions which are free from any cross-
coupling. For example, had the motors been placed directly on the joints, then
the wrist yaw motion would have become cross-coupled with the roll motion in
the sense that the torque in the roll joint is not only a function of the load in that
joint but also a function of the load in the yaw joint. Cross-coupling would
cause reduced controllability and inaccurate force reflection unless properly
decoupled or filtered in the software and control system. This additional
complexity is, therefore, removed by the appropriate mechanical design
described above. It can also be noted that while mutually orthogonal linear
motions are free from cross-coupling, the mutually orthogonal rotary motions are
cross-coupled and also have a kinematic singularity problem.

BILATERAL GRIP HANDLE
The development of the bilateral grip handle has been left as a separate
. exercise which will be undertaken soon. However, a brief description of its
present form is given here since it is an integral part of the master arm presented
in this paper.

As stated earlier, the design of the handle for the chosen kinematic
arrangement of: the master arm depends primarily on the relative position of the
master arm to the operator. A seated operator using a desk-top master arm
configuration was chosen as the starting point to focus on the design issues.
However the selected design is equally applicable to a standing operator
configuration. The simple pistol-grip type of handle looked more favourable
than the side-by-side thumb and index finger squeeze configuration which is
believed to be very fatiguing, Fig 5. The handle must be comfortable to use and
non-fatiguing.

A symmetrical handle is preferred in single-handed control systems, so that it
can be used by both left-handed and right-handed operators. The operator must
be able to move the handle up and down. Hence the grasping must be split and a
reaction post provided to prevent the hand grip from slipping during this motion.
It is not clear what would be the best combination for functionally splitting the
grasping fingers which are normally grouped together. Previous researchers and
developers have used both single index finger gripping and two fingers (index
and middle finger) gripping. Tichauer's work suggests that when the index
finger is used excessively, a defect known as tenosynovitis develops [8]. It
affects the ability of the person from flexing his or her index finger easily. It is
also needed to push and pull the master arm while maintaining a sensitive
bilateral grip of a remotely grasped delicate object. The lateral or left/right

motion of the master arm must be relatively easy with the handle free from any
control switches on the side of it. The bilateral gripping control must therefore
be free from any undesirable coupling between the handle and the master arm
kinematics.

Although several examples of handle/grip design have been presented so far,
the criteria for designing them is not well documented. However, once it is
designed using intuition and common sense, the efficacy of the man-machine
interface can be evaluated and design criteria proposed. Fig 6 shows the handle
design that has been chosen for the Cartesian mini Master Arm in schematic
form.

THE CONTROL SYSTEM

Fig 7 shows a block diagram of the control system under construction. The
NEATER robot is fitted with a 6-axis force/torque sensor to measure the end-
point forces and torques in the tool co-ordinate frame. The Robot Controller
(RC) is the standard VAL-II Control System and the Tele-Robot Controller
(TRC) is a PC based system being developed at Harwell. The trajectory control
performed by the VAL-II Control System can be modified by the alter port

, which requires displacement updates to the arm in the form of cartesian
displacements of the end-point. The commanded joint motions from the
cartesian mini master arm are therefore more or less directly compatible with the
alter port communication interface to the VAL-II trajectory control. Some form
of command modification is, however, required to avoid kinematic singularities
and joint travel limitations.

The force feedback control system, currently under development, is made to
bypass the VAL-II Robot Controller so that communication speed limits which
greatly affect the control system performance can be avoided. The slave robot's
end-point forces and torques measured by a force/torque sensor are conditioned
before they are used as force/torque commands for the master arm control
system. Local force feedback on the master arm is derived from the force
reflecting servo motor currents. Therefore, no direct force or torque
measurements are made in the master arm. It is planned to provide both resolved
position and resolved rate control modes so that the operator can easily select the
suitable mode he desires to accomplish a task efficiently. In future, it is planned
to improve the communication speed to the VAL-II trajectory control system by
using an upgraded slave port. The slave port provides a joint command interface
to the VAL-II trajectory control software and also provides joint position
feedback information for external use. This enables the evaluation of different
types of bilateral servo systems based on position-to-position control and
force/torque-to- position control schemes in cartesian workspace before a final
selection is made. The joint displacements read from the slave port must be
converted to cartesian displacements of the robot wrist. The conversion from
joint displacements to cartesian displacements is accomplished by using the

Jacobian of the robot kinematics. The Jacobian J(e); which relates velocity in
joint space to velocity in cartesian space is position dependent and therefore must
be computed each time the robot's position is updated. The Intel's 80386
processor based Tele-robot Controller has proved that this computation can be
carried out rapidly so that overall system response is not impaired.
THE STATUS OF DEVELOPMENT AND CONCLUSIONS
A mechanism breadboard has been built to prove the feasibility of
implementing the kinematic structure described earlier, Fig 8 (a). The
breadboard also assists in the design optimisation process and the subsequent
design and manufacture of the prototype. It also enabled us to understand better
the complex problems associated with the design of a multi-axis hand controller.
Several design changes were made to ensure that the prototype unit will be able
to exhibit homogeneous mechanical properties in all directions, Fig 8 (b). The
prototype unit will be operational by the end of 1990, and its dexterity will be
assessed against simpler devices such as two 3-axis joysticks and the 6-axis
Force/Torque ball. The assessment will employ each input device as a Master
command unit for NEATER during remote cutting operations.
, Force feedback technology and force reflecting command input devices have
taken a very long time to evolve to a state where cost-effective and satisfactory
systems are viable for wider use. The goal is to demonstrate that such an
economically viable command input device can be developed and be made
available for use on a variety of applications in the near future.
