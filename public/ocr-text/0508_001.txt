ABSTRACT
A new telerobotic manipulator has been produced for
use in nuclear and other industries where teleoperation
or robotics is required, and environmental conditions
exclude the use of standard manipulators. NEATER, the
Nuclear Engineered Advanced Telerobot, is based on the
adaption of a commercially available industrial robot to
the particular needs of the nuclear industry. AEA
Technology has worked directly with a robot manufacturer
to ensure that NEATER benefits from the long term reli-
ability that is common in_ industrial robots. “Radiation
tolerant sub-systems have been included in NEATER’s
design and three’ different versions are available to
meet a wide range of application areas. A_ telerobotic
controller is connected to the standard robot control-
ler. The prototype NEATER has __ successfully ‘operated
for over a year, with more than 1200 operating hours.
Trials using telerobotically deployed tools for glovebox
decommissioning have proved the concept, and _ robotic
operations such -as swabbing have been completed. The
paper describes the background to the design, identifies
the main features of NEATER and gives details of appli-
cation areas.
INTRODUCTION
The Remote Handling and Robotics Department [RHRD] of AEA
Technology has just completed the development of NEATER - the Nuclear
Engineered Advanced Telerobot. [Figure 1] NEATER represents a new
approach to remote handling, and is based on the adaption of a commerc-
ially available industrial robot design to the particular requirements of
the nuclear industry. The result is a manipulator which is significantly
cheaper than a purpose-built design, and which benefits from the experi-
ence gained of millions of operational hours of thousands of similar
models working in non-nuclear applications.
The NEATER concept has evolved over the last five years under the
Department of Energy funded Active Handling Programme. The potential for
using modified industrial robots came from a study completed in 1985 [1].

a) The Robotics Demonstration Facility is described in References 2 and 3. Several:
different robotic or telerobotic systems can be used to carry out inactive feas-
ibility trials of tasks such as surface monitoring, decontamination, decommiss-
ioning, waste handling and packaging.

robotic controller has also been built.[2,3] Input devices such as joy-
sticks or force balls are available to drive the robot [acting as a slave
manipulator] in a tool or world co-ordinate system. The robot acts as a
man-in-the-loop controlled manipulator, or telerobot. Programmed operat-
ion is still available, and off-line programming techniques can be used,
in conjunction with a proprietary kinematic modelling system, GRASP. New
input devices will allow force reflection.[4]

Teleoperation needs good viewing, and also in RHRD, a parallel
programme of work in 3-D TV for nuclear applications has produced robust
hardware. {5] The design of 3-D TV is based on guidelines that have
been tested in human factors evaluations of tasks using the 3-D TV and
other TV combinations, often with a manipulative task. [6]

Staéubli-Unimation and AEA Technology combined experience to develop
NEATER. Stiubli-Unimation carried out the mechanical design and manuf-
acture of a prototype machine based on their 20kg capacity PUMA-762 Clean
Room Robot. AEA Technology assessed the original design for radiation
tolerance, and specified the new materials and subsystems which were
incorporated in the design process. The machine has been at the Harwell
Laboratory for over one year and has accumulated over 1200 operational
hours experience without failure. Variants of the design have been built
and tested for a high activity application [10° Gy] and inactive trials
have continued using NEATER to investigate telerobotic decommissioning of
gloveboxes.

APPLICATION AREAS

The majority of remote handling operations in nuclear plant are
carried out by master slave manipulators, power manipulators, cranes and
special purpose machines. In general, except for low radiation environm-
ents robots are not used because radiation soon damages sensors, cabling
and any electronics. Many tasks would now be carried out using industr-
ial robots if the radiation hazard was removed, and the corollary is that
a radiation tolerant robot would be immediately useful to the industry.
Uncertainty in tasks and their precise description and the complexity of
non-repetitive operations is another factor that precludes strict robotic
operation of manipulators, and relies on the skills of human operators.
Telerobotic control is possible and our approach has been to use as much
of the supplied robotic controller as possible, but condition operator
commands for tool deployment before they are sent to the standard robot
controller. This provides a more robust system design because the
development effort applied to the robot controller is incorporated in the
overall product, and not lost to the customer. Pure robotic operations
and hybrid telerobotic/robotic control produces a easy-to-use interface
for the operator.

The mainstream applications for NEATER are thought to lie in the
areas of decommissioning and waste management. However, because of the
flexibility of application of the machine, it is envisaged that it will
also be applied to:

614
¢ fuel fabrication [including Mox fuels]
° filter changing
* waste drum handling
* inspection, monitoring and assay
¢ swabbing at any contamination level
* posting and bagging operations
¢ decontamination
* routine manipulation and tool deployment
* decommissioning, gloveboxes to reactors
FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

The development of NEATER was envisaged as a two stage process. [3]
Initially the robot design would be reworked with Stiubli Unimation to
produce a machine that was easy to service, had high reliability with the
attendant long service intervals, and use as many industrially sourced
components as possible. It would be a low-cost machine, compared to a
special purpose one-off design. This first stage would include a target
specification that would be useful for the majority of contaminated
environments. The high-radiation-tolerance applications would be tackled
in the second stage of the development programme. Wherever possible, the
first stage version would be designed to accommodate high radiation
tolerant components in the second stage up-grade.

The design was based on the PUMA 762 clean room robot, and the good
surface finish of this machine meant that it would be potentially easy to
decontaminate. The production of a prototype machine would allow many
radiation tolerant components to be included and tested for their compat-
ibility of operation. .Longer lead time developments would be added on to
the prototype machine in the second stage to bring its anticipated radi-
ation tolerance to beyond 104 Gy. Radiation testing of components and
subsystems was carried out at Harwell and the results were fed back into
the design and manufacturing process. It was found that a radiation tol-
crance of -106 Gy was possible through careful selection of components,
and so the two stage process has been completed through one prototype.

The robot and telerobotic controllers would be outside the radiolo-
gical controlled area, as shown in Figure 2. A maintenance review of the
machine was carried out to establish a procedure for dealing with failur-
es of a contaminated machine. The review identified the benefit of hav-
ing a removeable forearm [equivalent to a detachable wrist in a convent-
ional master-slave-manipulator]. A weight reduction of 100kg to ease the
burden on in-cell handling equipment, was also shown to be possible, by
simply making the base in two pieces which could be remotely mated in
cell, if a plinth was not available. [Figure 3] Split-ring seals were
added at major joints to increase the sealing efficiency and allow the
use of a free-running pressurised decontamination wash down, prior to
maintenance.

Basic performance parameters of the machine are unchanged. It has
the same load capacity as the 762 PUMA and the same reach. However it was
realised that variants were required to cover the vast range of potential
nuclear environments. The machine can be configured to suit three main
combinations of activity and contamination.

1) A basic radiation tolerant version of the clean room PUMA
. Without modularity or improved sealing, for high radiation,
low contamination applications [for example in waste drum
handling or swabbing] - designated PUMA 762N [N for nuclear]

2) A modular version, with improved seals but not highly
radiation tolerant, for applications where decontamination is
necessary but radiation levels are low [for example in
replacement of or assistance to pressurised-suit operations}
- designated PUMA 762M [M for modular].

3) A radiation tolerant decontaminable version, which can be
used in the most extreme environments with modularity to help
maintenance - designated PUMA 762NM [nuclear and modular].

The prototype NEATER at Harwell began as Version 2, with modular-
ity, improved seals and some radiation tolerant components. It is now
being brought to the target tolerance of 106 Gy, [Version 3] by the add-
ition of specially redesigned radiation tolerant encoders.

SPECIFICATION OF PRODUCTION NEATERS

As mentioned, the 20kg capacity of the 762 PUMA is available in the
NEATER design at a top speed of 0.4ms-!. At ims-! this is reduced to
12kg. An increased reach version [the 761 PUMA], is also available in
all three nuclear environment versions.

The final specification for the most advanced model, the 762NM is
summarised as:

Load Capacity 20kg at a reach of 1.4m

Maximum velocity 0.4ms-![20kg] or 1.0ms-!{12kg]

Repeatability[robotic operation] +0.2mm

Operational temperature 10-50°C

Radiation Tolerance 106Gy [100M rad] integrated By

dose anticipated before major
overhaul-based on sub system &
component test irradiations.

Contamination protection double seals on all axes and

covers including grease packed
labyrinth seals on axes 1-4 and
wrist gaiter on axes 5 and 6.

Modularity splittable at elbow [joint 3] &

at base.

Maintainability all bolts, fixings & electrical

interconnects designed for rem-

ote assembly/disassembly
Weight whole robot 568kg

forearm only 66kg

base stand 112kg

EXPERIENCE WITH NEATER
Maintenance of NEATER
All components on NEATER are designed to be easily removed if
maintenance operations are required. All the bolts and fixings may need
to be manipulated by pressurized suit operators, and they are designed to
accept tools that can also be deployed by another manipulator. Electric-
al and service connectors are the quick-release type. The maintenance
sequence is made up of the following steps
« detect failure
¢ diagnose fault and identify remedial action
* separate robot arm at joint 3 remotely, if appropriate
* transfer forearm and wrist or upper arm, shoulder, and trunk to
decontamination area
« decontaminate, remove gaiters, and monitor exterior of machine
* transfer to low radiation and contamination maintenance area
* remove arm covers and monitor interior
¢ dismantle, repair, replace and readjust assemblies to correct
fault; hands-on or semi-remote maintenance in a glovebox.
* undertake preventative maintenance tasks; recalibrate potentio-
meters
¢ replace arm covers and seal, external seals and gaiters
* carry out functional tests
e transfer to working cell
* reassemble robot arm at joint 3 remotely
* operate machine.
Glovebox Decommissioning
Inactive trials at Stiubli Unimation’s Telford works and at Harwell
Laboratory have been carried out over the last year. More than 1200
operational hours have been experienced without failures of the special
components in the manipulator or in the standard controller. The tele-
robotic controller [originally consisting of three communicating PCs] has
been rebuilt using a single 486 PC. Work on glovebox decommissioning
trials has continued, using a range of cutting tools that are currently
used in manual glovebox decommissioning [Figure 4].
Many tools such as nibblers, bandsaws, hacksaws, jigsaws and drills
have been tried, to investigate the best performance in cutting up to 6mm
steel plate. [Figures 5,6] Most of the tools require compliant mountings

to isolate the telerobot from parasitic vibrations, and to prevent tool
jams. The tools have a common interface with the robot which allows easy
exchange either through a gloved change or through a tool change station.

Contamination Survey
Two NEATER robots have been supplied to swab the outsides of high
level vitrified waste containers. The specification called for 50°C
operation, with a contact dose of up to 5.103 Gy per hour. 750 cycles
per year are demanded from the manipulators, and over a two year period
an integrated dose of 106 Gy could be expected. Because there is
unlikely to be a contamination hazard to the machine, PUMA 761N_ versions
[radiation tolerant, no modularity or extra sealing] were supplied.

620

Inactive demonstrations of the system were performed following a
simulation using GRASP. The robots had to perform complete surface swab-
bing, providing a fixed contact pressure, and then exchange the swab at a
transfer station. The first robot was produced and delivered after cust-
omer acceptance trials, and was followed by the second machine. Radiat-
ion tolerant encoders have been fitted and it is anticipated that the
first manipulator will be installed in an active area in late 1990.
CONCLUSIONS

The development programme has lasted two years and has resulted in
a commercially available telerobot which can easily be used in a variety
of nuclear applications. The short development timescale was possible
because of the co-operation of an established robot manufacturer, and the
ability to test, specify and re-engineer radiation tolerant components at
Harwell. The use of the prototype and subsequent machines in active
trials is anticipated within AEA Technology’s Decommissioning and Rad-
waste programme, following the conclusion of inactive proving trials, and
commercial versions have been supplied to a high radiation tolerance
application.
