Development of a general purpose hand controller for advanced
teleoperation

ABSTRACT
A development project has been initiated at Harwell Laboratory to
investigate the feasibility and ramifications of a general purpose
hand controller for bilateral control of standard 6-axis manipulators
and robots. By general purpose, it is meant that the input command
device shall be capable of co-ordinating and controlling the remote
manipulator's joints as the operator desires. Forces and torques may

. also be reflected on the three positional and three orientational
axes of the hand controller giving the operator a kinesthetic sense
of the task he is manipulating remotely. Since the kinematics and
dynamics are dissimilar between the hand controller and _ the
manipulator, the implementation of the unilateral and bilateral
control system requires a computer to deal with these disparities.
This paper reviews the state of the art of general purpose hand
controllers and examines the use of parallel link and hybrid
serial-parallel link structures for use in the development of an
efficient bilateral hand controller, as part of the on-going Nuclear
Robotics Programme at Harwell.

1. Introduction

The increased need for remote manipulation in hazardous environments -
Nuclear, Undersea, Outerspace etc, has been widely recognized. Complex and
unplanned tasks are difficult to perform with programmable or robotic remote
manipulators. Human judgement, skill and sensory interaction are often
needed to perform these tasks successfully and safely. The sensory
information to the operator during remote manipulation includes vision,
hearing and kinesthetic sensations. Additional information on the remote
task environment (such as temperature, humidity etc) is also beneficial in
these operations. A mechanical input device such as a joystick or a master
arm is normally used to control the movements of the remote manipulator.
Force reflection is added to the input device to enhance the remote
manipulative performance. The state of the art of advanced general purpose
hand controllers is not well developed. Perhaps an evidence for this is the
number of different input devices used today to control robots and
manipulators. The comparative merits are not yet established. This paper
describes the features of a compact 6-axis input device based on parallel
linkages for single-handed operation of a remote manipulator, currently
under development at Harwell Laboratory.
Even though the emphasis made in this paper is the use of a general purpose
hand controller in the control of a general 6-axis "shoulder-elbow-wrist "
type of manipulator, it has potential for uses in a large variety of
manipulations. The basic requirements for such a device are examined from
the viewpoint of general manipulations and efficient operator interactions.
These basic requirements for a good general purpose hand controller are
believed to be:
(i) The controller must have six degrees-of-freedom so that the

6-axis slave manipulator can be commanded by displacements in

the controller to move the slave to any point in its workspace

and be orientated at any desired attitude angle.
(ii) The control input device must be easily backdriveable so that

the fatigue levels of the operator can be kept to a minimum.
(iii) The operator must be capable of generating input commands of

more than one axis simultaneously with minimum or no

unintended movements on other axes using one hand only.

‘ (iv) It must be possible to indicate the external forces/torques

being applied at the slave manipulator, during manipulation,

to the operator using force/torque feedback to the hand

controller.

(v) A suitable base in the hand controller for the operator to

rest his wrist so that fine motions can be generated when

needed in performing a remote task.
An example of a control input device embodying most of these basic
requirements is the bilateral or force-reflecting master-slave manipulator.
The disadvantages of this device are its large operational volume, thus
increasing fatigue and lessening safety, and its high cost. It is mainly
under these circumstances, that a general purpose efficient hand controller
becomes attractive.

278

2. Review of General Purpose Hand Controllers
The range of general purpose hand controllers can be classified into two
broad categories:
(i) Geometrically dissimilar master arm
(ii) Cartesian co-ordinate command input device
A geometrically dissimilar compact master arm was developed by JPL Tele-
operator Laboratory (1),(2),(3) and is called a Universal Force Reflecting
Hand Controller. Fig 1 shows the kinematic arrangement of this device. It
has been mechanically and electrically counterbalanced and provides force
reflection.
There are several types of cartesian input devices developed for the control
of a 6-axisS manipulator in the cartesian frame. Fig 2 shows the X-Y-Z
motion generation by the controller developed at MIT's Man-Machine System
Laboratory (4). A special purpose joystick handle with micro switches is
used to command the other axes of motion. An experimental 3-D joystick
developed by CEGB's Marchwood Engineering Laboratory (5) also uses the pure
X-Y-Z form of kinematics. Fig 3 shows a hand controller with X-Y-Z
translational motions and usual pitch/roll motions developed by Harwell
Laboratory specifically for the control of a micro manipulator called Elite.
The hand controller under development by the University of Florida is shown
in Fig 4 (6), and is called a Universal Floating-Hand Controller. The
device does not provide force reflection at present (7).
The 6-axis control input device developed by CAE Electronics Ltd, Canada
(8) provides + 0.5ins (13mm) for the X-Y-Z motions and + 15 degrees for the
rotary ¢-B-%& command inputs. An ordinary 3-axis joystick is used for
the rotary motions. The X-Y motions are generated using a parallelogram.
linkage arrangement and the Z-movement by a normal translational action.
All the axis of movements are sprung to return to the neutral position and
no other external force feedback is provided.
The input devices described above require some displacement to generate
either position or rate command(s). However, it is also possible to
generate cartesian frame based input commands without any displacements
using a fixed force/torque ball, Fig 5. It would not be possible to use
bilateral control to provide force reflection using these devices. A
number of controllers are commercially available based on Force/Torque Ball
Joysticks (9),(10),(11). Sometimes two 3-axis joysticks are used to
generate X-Y-Z motions and wrist orientations but they limit the use of
single-handed operation (12),(13), Fig 6.
It must be pointed out that there is no hand controller which could even
approximately match the dexterity and manipulative capabilities of the human
hand. Two critical performance parameters, the task performance time and
the number of errors made during the performance of the task can provide a
good index for the effectiveness of a hand controller. This could be
compared against the performance when the task is carried out directly by a
human operator.
279

3. The Principle of Single-Handed Operation

Amongst the possible methods and devices for controlling a remote
manipulator, identical master-slave control system with force reflection
nearly approaches the direct operations by an operator. However, it limits
the human capabilities - necessitates the use of the other hand to control
interaction of axes, increases operator fatigue and imposes safety problems
under bilateral control. It will also be difficult to control other
functions in the system such as remote viewing when both hands are needed
for the control of manipulation. Sometimes, two manipulator arms are used
to perform a task. For example, one arm holding an object while the other
is used to do some work on it, or use of both arms to move an object in a
desired path or trajectory. Therefore, what is needed in these instances,
is a single hand controller to control the movements of an operator. The
input device must ideally permit an operator to direct each of the two arms
to grasp an object at chosen locations, simultaneously if necessary and then
to perform a desired operation such as moving it from one place to another
along a designated path.
Computer control can be used to adopt strategies that will minimise operator
fatigue and maximise the system performance. In the bilateral control mode,
forces due to the dead weight of the slave manipulator, can be cancelled out
and force-feedback actuation can be turned off when the maniputator is
stationary. Different control modes such as position control, rate control,
force contro] and bilateral control can be selected at will to accomplish a
task. To make the best use of human judgement, all possible information on
task ‘environment and the task itself must be communicated to the operator
for interpretation or perception.
It will be useful to have a larger displacement range in the hand controller
as practicably as possible to enhance the operator's accuracy. Since there
is disparity between the motion ranges in a compact hand controller and a
slave manipulator, it is necessary to incorporate different control modes.
The motion ranges could be scaled to match each other under position
control. Alternatively, rate control can be used for the gross motions in
the workspace and 1:1 fine incremental motions between the hand controller
and the slave unit near the task zone. Should the hand controller reach one
or more of its displacement travel limits, it could be allowed to return to
the neutral position under computer control without causing any movements in
the slave, (similar to the positioning of the cursor in a display screen
using a mouse). Almost all researchers now agree that an efficient hand
controller must be capable of providing force feedback to the operator.
Kinesthetic sensations can be regarded as essential in certain kinds of
remote manipulation because most actions depend upon the perception of the
manipulative forces. In addition to the enhancement of operator's
commanding accuracy, larger motion ranges in the hand controller are also
essential to allow the force feedback actuators sufficient displacement for
better functioning.
The important principles need to be embodied in the design of a general
purpose hand controller for single handed operations can therefore be
summarised as follows:

(a) Compact kinematics or geometry

(b) Sufficient displacement ranges

(c) Easy backdriveability and minimum cross coupling between motions

(d) Kinematics solvability for computer-aided control

(e) Mechanism rigidity for achieving increased servo stiffness in

the force feedback servos.
280

The need for the solution of the direct kinematics problem can be easily
understood when the parallel link mechanism is used as an input device,
Fig 7. The inverse kinematic problem and the Jacobian matrix of the
mechanism are needed when adding force reflecting characteristics to this
input device, Fig 8.
It is also being considered whether a hybrid form of the mechanism, using
part of the parallel link topology for the X-Y-Z motions and the
conventional serial link arrangement for the wrist “%-P-¥- motions (as
used in the earlier Harwell's hand controller for the Elite manipulator)
could also be a good compromise between computational complexity and
mechanical simplicity.

4. Description of the New Hand Controller
A new hand controller based on parallel linkage topology is under develop-
ment at Harwell Laboratory, Fig 9. Some research has already been carried
out on the use of parallel links for stiff robotic structures after
Stewart and McGough (14) who used this arrangement for the first time
to generate aircraft flight simulations and tyre testing machine motions
respectively. There are research machines based on this mechanism at the
Marconi Research Centre (UK), University of Florida (USA), Oregan State
University (USA), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (USA) and the
National Research Institute for Information and Automation (INRIA - France).
A commercial robot marketed by GEC, called "GADFLY" for the assembly of
components in the electronics industry uses part of this topology (15).
Three parallel links are used for the positioning and a serially linked
conventional 3-axis wrist used for orientations. The mechanical arrangement
using parallel compliant links has also been used to provide passive
compliance in the end-effector for performing robotic assembly tasks (16).
An experimental application has been reported where the robot performs an
assembly task on a six degrees-of-freedom workstation based on parallel link
mechanism (17). Some 6-axis force/torque sensors are also constructed
around this parallel link structure (18).
The parallel mechanism is more rigid and more accurate than a serial
mechanism but the disadvantages are more joints and smaller working volume.
The joints in the parallel manipulator are passive and only the linear
travels are active under computer control.
There are several forms of this 6-axis parallel mechanism being studied for
various applications. Many authors have published material on the kinematic
analysis of these mechanisms for use as a robotic device (19),(20),(21),(22)
which indicates recent increased interest in this mechanism. As a robotic
device, the kinematic problem is, as usual, "What are the values of joint
(leg lengths) variables for a given position and orientation of the gripper
in space?" However, as an input device or a hand controller, it is
necessary to determine the cartesian position and orientation for a given
configuration or leg lengths of the parallel link platform. Even though the
values of the joint variables (ball joints, universal joints) are not needed
in the control or use of it as an input device, the range of these joint
variables is needed, for instance, during the design of the mechanism.
E F Fichter et al has described a method for determining these values (23).

281

The displacement equations given in the Appendix show that the inverse
kinematic problem of finding the leg lengths for a given end-effector
position is readily solvable, but the direct kinematics problem is a rather
difficult task since it involves the solution of a set of highly non-linear
Simultaneous equations. The situation is, therefore, exactly the opposite
of the case of the kinematics of a serial link or open chain manipulator.
The hand controller is based on the conventional design of a parallel link
manipulator. There is a Hooke or Universal joint at the base end and a
large angle (25° - 40°) ball and socket joint at the platform end of the
link. A backdriveable linear slide is interposed between these joints for
the telescopic action of the links. This will be replaced by a
backdriveable linear actuator (eg rack and pinion) when force feedback is to
be added to the hand controller.
5. Conclusions

A feasibility study of a platform type of input device for remote
manipulations has been carried out using mock-up models and elementary
theoretical analysis. Findings until now show that a careful assessment is
needed to determine a choice between a fully parallel link mechanism and a
hybrid serial-parallel mechanism for use as a general purpose hand
controller structure. It is believed that teleoperations can be efficiently
performed using this type of compact displacement type of input device. It
has features such as structural rigidity, a base for resting operator's
wrist/hand and small but safe operational volume for bilateral control.
The input device presented in this paper will form one of the type of input
devices available at Harwell in the future to make an assessment of
Man-Machine Interface for motions between human operator and a remote
manipulator or a robot. The types of input devices planned for this
experimental assessment programme include the following:

(a) Scaled replica master arm (with and without force reflection)

(b) Two 3-axis joysticks (resolved cartesian rate control)

(c) Single fixed displacement 6-axis force/torque joystick

| (d) Single displaceable 6-axis joystick (with and without force
reflection)
The material presented in this paper will be experimentally evaluated,
clarified and expanded in the future.

APPENDIX Kinematics and Inverse Kinematics of 6 Axis Parallel Link Mechanism
The problem of inverse kinematics is more straightforward for a parallel link
manipulator than for a serial link manipulator. Therefore, the problem of finding the
link lengths for a given position and orientation of the top platform based on Yang's
[19] method is outlined first.

The locations of the ball joints and universal joints can now be expressed in their

where Y is the angle between ball joints A, and A, and so on; and Cy and Sy represents
Cos Y and Sin Y respectively. Similarly 6 is the angle between B, and B, and so on.
The position of the platform relative to the fixed base can be defined by a vector p
which is a position vector from the origin of the base co-ordinate system X-Y-Z to the
origin of the platform co-ordinate system u~v-w:
t
BP = (Py Py Pz)
Similarly, the orientation of the platform relative to the base can be defined by a
rotation matrix R:

Where (ays Qe Gy)» (bys bys Bods and (Vy: Vys Vin) are the direction cosines of the
axes Uu, V and w with respect to the fixed X-Y-Z co-ordinate system. The geometrical
relationship between the fixed co-ordinate frame and the moving co-ordinate frame is
usually represented by a 4x4 homogeneous transformation matrix as follows:
—

The location of each ball joint (A, through Ag) on the moving top platform with
respect to the fixed co-ordinate frame can now be obtained as:
Px] r-
: = LT], Oo, and so on
|
ZS ay |
The link lengths can be obtained by calculating the distance between the corresponding
pair of joints in the moving top plate and the fixed base. For example:
x | [ rt Xp xX R

y ~ Oy Vp. y
Zz Al Oe rt 2p | Z Bl O°
Hence, 1¢ = (a, r+ Xp 7 R)* + (ay rt Vp)* tip r + Zp)*-
The above form therefore represents a set of explicit input-output equations for the
inverse kinematics of the parallel link mechanism. It can also be seen that the
direct kinematics problem involves the solution of a set of non-linear simultaneous
equations.
