UKAEA's site at Harwell was established in 1946 as the UK's centre for nuclear R&D.
Some facilities are still operating but decommissioning has always been a feature of the
changing response to nuclear programmes, the need to make space for new facilities or
simply dealing with redundant plant. In the extreme, reactors and nuclear plant have been
moved to other UKAEA sites.
Two of the early reactors at Harwell, BEPO and GLEEP have been in Care and Maintenance
(C&M) for some time - BEPO was shut down in 1968 as was GLEEP in 1990.
Decommissioning began at a new pace in the early '90s, when PLUTO and DIDO, the two
Materials Test Reactors, went through the first two stages of decommissioning and were
placed in long term C&M. Other facilities, including the Variable Energy Cyclotron, the
LIDO reactor and the Chemical Engineering Buiding were cleared of radiological and
chemotoxic hazards and demolished. Some of these buildings contained facilities that
themselves had been in various forms of C&M (including virtual abandonment) for several
decades.
So at Harwell, UKAEA have gained significant experience of early and delayed
decommissioning, over five decades, will be keeping some facilities in C&M for four more
decades and then will be continuing to operate waste storage facilities for several more
decades.
Modern Safety Cases are being developed for the operating nuclear facilities at Harwell
(including the reactors in C&M). Engineering Substantiation supports the deterministic
element required in a safety case and is there to underpin the safety arguments. Engineering
Substantiation requires attention to the detail of design or operational intent, tracks the
lifecycle of the safety-related Structure, System or Component (SSC) against modern
standards and compares the expectation with observation of the real situation in the
operating facility. The process considers explicitly the potential for ageing and other
degradation effects on the reliability of any of the plant items (SSCs) that must perform a
safety function. The results are presented in Engineering Substantiation Reports (ESRs) as
support files within the new Safety Cases.
The paper will present the features of the Engineering Substantiation process at Harwell and
highlight the arrangements that are being put in place to establish configured sets of
knowledge, including design and safety information. Forward actions, plant condition and
performance constraints will be recorded as baselines for future safety reviews. The
retention and maintenance of plant knowledge will ensure that future safety managers and
decommissioning teams will be able to understand the condition of their facility and its
sensitivity to physical, environmental and any external influences that could contribute to
ageing or other degradation effects.
