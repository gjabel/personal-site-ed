ABSTRACT

AEA Technology has developed, and now supplies, products that can reduce the cost and improve
the reliability of decommissioning and radwaste operations. This paper describes some of the
features of these products, which include NEATER, a telerobot based on acommercial industrial
robot, and TV’ - an engineered 3-D TV System. The products are designed for the radiation
and environmental conditions of a range of nuclear plant. The operator-robot interface has been
improved by the provision of a telerobotic controller, and of a new multi-degree-of-freedom
force reflecting input device, that can also be used to control many different types of slave
manipulator. Human factors experiments and field trials have proved that the TV’ system gives
useful performance benefits and is comfortable to view. NEATER and TV’ are affordable,
robust systems which make telerobotics a realistic option for the nuclear industry.

INTRODUCTION |
The Remote Handling and Robotics Department of AEA Technology has recently evolved a
special approach to solving remote handling problems. Although in the past, its in-house
development programme has produced sophisticated manipulators for use in decommissioning
and fuel cycle operations, in general its experience has been that its traditional approach to
development led to long timescales.
In 1984, anew approach was devised, that had the potential to reduce the development timescale,
and bring remote handling products into operation much more quickly [1]. The new approach
is made up of five key principles:

° use techniques proven in previous projects

° use off-the-shelf solutions wherever possible

° if not, adapt and modify existing equipment

° develop special equipment only when necessary

° anticipate evolution.
By 1987 some of these principles had been applied in building telerobotic controllers for
industrial robots, and in producing robust black and white and colour 3-D TV systems [2,3].
The next goal was to build fully-engineered robotic and viewing hardware that could be used
inradioactive environments. Instead of building totally novel hardware, solutions were proposed
that incorporated a blend of existing equipment design, special material selection [to survive in
an active environment], and re-engineering to meet particular size or maintenance constraints.
Equipment suppliers were involved in re-engineering to the necessary target specifications.
The result has been the rapid prototyping and subsequent production engineering of NEATER
(the Nuclear Engineered Advanced Telerobot), and TV’ (the engineered 3-D TV system). This
paper describes the development of NEATER and TV’, and the associated work on a telerobotic
input device.
As a result of the programme of design, testing, and development described here, simple
hardware is now available to make telerobotics easy, for operators, designers and manufacturers.
TELEROBOTICS
Telerobotics is a blanket term relating to systems which can support both remote manipulation
with a human operator in the loop and programmed manipulator operations. In consequence
telerobotics combines all that is best in industrial robotics with all the skills of a human operator
to respond to ill defined and unpredictable tasks.

| From this definition it is clear that the operator requires both a means of exercising control and

feedback information about how the remote manipulator is performing. Most experience in the
nuclear industry is of mechanically-linked master-slave manipulators [MSMs] with direct
viewing through a shielding window. The hydraulic manipulator developed at Harwell[4] has
a greatly increased payload compared to MSMs, but still relies on visual feedback except when
executing a pre-programmed task. Without the benefit of force feedback, tasks have to be
carefully controlled by the operator.

NEATER can operate as a telerobotic manipulator because a Telerobotic Controller [TRC] has
been built and attached to the standard controller [5]. The TRC conditions demands from the
input devices - joysticks or force balls - so that the end effector moves smoothly throughout
NEATER’s considerable operating volume. A touch-screen interface sets up the different
operating modes of the telerobot.

In their basic forms, both the hydraulic manipulator and NEATER are unilateral manipulators.
However bilateral (force feedback) control of both manipulators will become possible using the
kinematically dissimilar Cartesian mini-Master Arm. TV’, the engineered stereoscopic TV
system enhances the ability of an operator to perceive and control complex tasks in a nuclear
environment. These two developments are described in the following paragraphs.

INPUT DEVICES

Simple input devices such as three-degree-of-freedom joysticks can be used to control NEATER
through the TRC. A new development is the Cartesian mini Master Arm which provides end
point bilateral control of remote manipulative operations. The system is designed to be easily
maintained, to produce useful force feedback from within a generous operational volume and
to be simple to interface with the TRC and auxiliary processors.

Figure 1 shows a outline of the prototype Cartesian mini Master Arm, which will be operational
at the end of 1990. It is an optimised structure, consisting of a parallel-serial linkage in a
gravitationally balanced package. The mechanism is symmetrical and has homogeneous
mechanical properties. Low force/torque friction thresholds produce a comfortable responsive
control without fatigue or mis-cued information.

TV’

TV’, the engineered stereoscopic TV systems developed by AEA Technology, give operators
or observers a 3-D view of aremote scene which may be part of an inspection, repair, maintenance
or decomissioning task. There are many tangible benefits of TV’, which have been achieved
by a thorough understanding of how three dimensional images should be re-constructed and
presented for remote viewing. Unlike time interlaced systems, TV? produces no flicker, and
simple polarized spectacles are all that are needed to view the display. The viewer can use the
TV’ display for long periods of time without eyestrain or other forms of fatigue, which are

common in most other forms of 3-D TV system. Auxiliary tasks and use of VDUs are in no ,
way inhibited by the use of the polarised spectacles. Among the benefits of good stereo TV
over 2-D viewing systems for manipulation tasks are:

° there are significant time savings in performing manipulation tasks

° the number of cameras required may be smaller

° positioning of cameras and lights is easier

° complex tasks are completed with fewer manipulative movements

° the risk of collision damage to manipulators and their environment is reduced.
Figure 2 shows the radiation tolerantcamera built for in-reactor inspection. Cameras and displays
have been built for both colour and black-and-white systems. Applications include 3-D computer
graphics, 3-D flow visulization, and systems for decommissioning operations.
NEATER
NEATER, the Nuclear Engineered Advanced Telerobot is based on the mechanism design of
Staubli-Unimation’s clean room PUMA 762 robot. The radiation tolerance objective was
achieved in a two-stage programme, with a tolerance of 10“Gy achieved initially, followed later
by upgrading to 10°Gy by back-fitting improved components.
Working with Staubli-Unimation, AEA Technology examined every component and subsystem
for radiation tolerance. An initial assessment of the robot identified a number of areas with
obvious radiation tolerance problems, for example, cable and wire insulation, lubricants, motors,
optical shaft encoders. Substitution of equivalent materials which were radiation tolerant was
carried out wherever possible, but some components needed to be completely re-engineered.
The optical shaft encoders fell into this category. After considering the alternative of replacing
the encoders with resolvers, it was decided to re-engineer the encoders. This involved a new
circuit design, using components that were stable when irradiated, or at least varied in a
predictable way. Using the RHRD radiation effects database, supplemented by extra testing, a
computer simulation of a range of possible circuit designs was undertaken. On the basis of this
simulation, an optimal design for a radiation tolerant encoder was selected and built. Prototypes
were successfully tested in the Harwell fuel ponds, and then exercised on NEATER itself.
A maintenance review indicated that extra seals were required at the joints, so that NEATER
could withstand contamination, and also be decontaminated easily. The manipulator is designed
to be split into three components. A split base offers a weight reduction of 100kg. A removeable
forearm eases in-cell maintenance procedures, and extensive use of quick release connectors
and special tapering bolt heads facilitates active maintenance of the machine [Figure 3].

‘ The resulting manipulator [Figure 4] has all the mechanical design features of an ordinary
industrial robot, and benefits from the knowledge gained during millions of operational hours
in non-nuclear applications.

EXPERIENCE WITH NEATER
NEATER was officially launched at the IBC Conference on the Applications of Robotics in the
Maintenance, Inspection and Refurbishment of Nuclear Installations, in December 1989.
Inactive trials at Staubli-Unimation’s Telford works and at Harwell Laboratory have been carried
out over the last year. More than 1200 operational hours of experience have accumulated without
a failure of any of the special components in the manipulator or standard controller. In the
interests of economy, the telerobotic controller has now been rebuilt using a single 486PC. Work
on glovebox cutting and decommissioning trials have continued, with robotic deployment of
many of the tools that are currently being used in manual decommissioning.
Tools such as nibblers, bandsaws [Figure 5], hacksaws, jigsaws and drills have been tried, to
establish which give the best performance in cutting up to 6mm steel plate. Most of the tools
require compliant mountings to isolate the telerobot from parasitic vibrations and to prevent
tool jams. The tools have a common interface with the robot which allows them to be exchanged
either manually at a gloved change station or robotically at a tool change station. A jaw change
mechanism developed for the hydraulic manipulator is being adapted for use with NEATER.
NEATER comes in three basic forms [6]:
1) A basic radiation tolerant version of the clean room PUMA
without modularity or improved sealing, for high radiation,
low contamination applications [for example in waste drum
handling or swabbing] - designated PUMA 762N [N for
nuclear].
2) A modular version, with improved seals but not highly
radiation tolerant, for applications where the
decontamination is necessary but radiation levels are low
[for example in replacement or assistance to
pressurised-suit operations] - designated PUMA 762M [M
for modular].
3) Aradiation tolerant decontaminable version, which can be
used in the most extreme environments, with modularity to
help maintenance-designated PUMA 762NM [nuclear and
modular].

The prototype NEATER at Harwell began as Version 2, with modularity, improved seals and °
some radiation tolerant components. It is now being brought up to the target tolerance of 10°
Gy, [Version 3] by the addition of the radiation tolerant encoders.
Two NEATER robots have been supplied to the nuclear industry, to swab the outsides of high
level vitrified waste containers. The specification called for 50°C operation, with a contact dose
of up to 5.10° Gy per hour. 750 cycles per year were demanded from the manipulators, so that
over a two year period an integrated dose of 10° Gy could be expected. Because there was
unlikely to be a contamination hazard to the machine, PUMA 761N versions [radiation tolerant,
no modularity or extra sealing] were supplied.
Inactive demonstrations of the system were performed following a simulation using GRASP.
The robots had to perform complete surface swabbing, providing a fixed contact pressure, and
then exchange the swab at a transfer station. The first robot was produced and delivered after
customer acceptance trials, and was shortly followed by a second machine. Radiation tolerant
encoders have been fitted, and it is anticipated that the first manipulator will be installed in an
active area in late 1990.
CONCLUSIONS
The development programmes to produce NEATER and TV? in radiation tolerant form have
been successful. The time taken from the prototype stage to a fully-engineered production piece
of equipment has been short, and this is a direct result of working closely with manufacturers
to set design specifications that are achievable and are based on existing knowledge of systems
used in a wider field than nuclear engineering. New developments such as the Cartesian mini
Master Arm will enhance the capabilities of NEATER and the hydraulic manipulator, and
radiation effects research, testing and design will continue to provide new solutions by adapting
existing equipment. Telerobotics made easy is now a justified claim.
