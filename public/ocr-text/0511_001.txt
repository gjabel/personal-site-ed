Introduction
In the early 1960s, the United Kingdom
Atomic Energy Authority (the ——
Authority) experimented with different '
types of processes that would facilitate
safe, long-term storage of highly active
liquid wastes. The Fixation in Glass of
Active Liquors (FINGAL) project
explored the feasibility of producing 50 HA
