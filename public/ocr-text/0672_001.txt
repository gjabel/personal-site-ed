feasible, but introduce difficulties in the design of

tracks in common with existing transport modes. More-
over, the guidance significantly increases the track
conductor costs above those needed for levitation, and
the trough-like contour provides a trap for debris.

) Since guidance can also be achieved by omitting
conducting strips, some of these cbjections can be
overcome by a flat guideway design. A possible scheme
