A COOPERATIVE RESEARCH PROGRAMME TO INVESTIGATE THE APPLICATION OF AIR-CORED
LINEAR SYNCHRONOUS MACHINES TO ADVANCED GROUND TRANSPORT
1.0. Introduction

Railways throughout the world are beginning to rely more heavily on
advances in technology to increase their effectiveness as a transport mode
compared to the airplane and motorcar. In doing so the emphasis is usually
placed on achieving higher average speeds to generate a commercial gain of
reduced trip time, with the conflicting constraint of increase of cost usually
providing the limiting factor.

Some areas where the impact of new technologies can be immediately felt
are:

@ Aerodynamic drag reduction

@ Required energy reduction

e Tare weight per seat reduction

@ More efficient use of track

e Better forms of traction and power conversion

® Higher average speeds through improved suspensions
e Increases in load factor

e@ Use of automation to reduce required manpower

Although some of these effects can be achieved by slight extensions to
common practice, others represent distinct changes in philosophy for railway
adminstrations. In particular, the trend has developed to produce fixed
formation, articulated-rake trains with integral power for operation in the
high speed 200-300 km/h (125-186 mph) range. Likewise, there is a growing
interest in the development of novel techniques of propulsion, guidance and
suspension for the very high speeds of 300-500 km/h (186-310 mph).

In all the proposed configurations, the method of trac tion chosen will
heavily influence the other subsystems' design. For example, to meet the
tractive power requirement at 500 km/h, either a wheel trainset with the best
of conventional traction motors, or an attractive, magnetically-levitated
vehicle with linear induction motor drive, would face severe problems in
finding adequate remaining space for payloads.

The following proposal outlines the areas of existing work on AGT
traction systems and suggests a possible line of research on one of the more
promising of the linear drive systems, i.e. the air-cored, linear synchronous

Br ill soe

machine using superconducting magnets.
2.0. Existing Traction Methods

2.1. Conventional Vehicles

At present the majority of passenger vehicles are either diesel or
electrically-powered. Although there was brief interest in the gas turbines
which were built for the experimental versions of BR's APT and SNCF's TGV,
the pre-production prototypes of these trains are electrically powered. It
is to be expected that the expected increase in the price of oil and its
adverse environmental effects will both eventually lead to the adoption of
all-electric propulsion for ground transport in the foreseeable future.

Electric drives can be divided into three main classes, determined by
the motor type

i) + DC drives. The d.c. machine has for long been the most common
drive motor because its full load torque capability at low speeds matches
the traction requirement. As size and speed increase, however, commutation
problems occur, and so the machines tend to be run at relatively slower
rates. The recent use of semiconductor choppers for power regulation enables
more efficient housekeeping of the energy used in accelerating and braking.

ii) Synchronous drives. If a synchronous machine is fed and controlled
by a semiconductor inverter, its speed/torque characteristics can be made to
match those of a d.c. machine. The rotor can be more robust than a d.c.
machine's and requires slip-rings rather than a commutator, so higher
peripheral speeds are possible producing a more efficient overall machine
suited to large power ratings. However, with the exception of some Urban
Transport applications, this motor has been relatively ignored for high power
traction.

iii) Asynchronous drives. The induction motor with either a cage or
cup secondary (rotor) can be used in two main modes. Using voltage control
and secondary resistance insertion the torque/speed characteristic can be
made to suit the traction need. An alternative approach is to use an
inverter to match frequency with running speed so that the motor operates at
similar slips as its speed increases. If the voltage/frequency ratio is
kept constant then the load torque can be met with full pole flux implying
the most efficient operation. A particular example of a modification of
this concept is BR's Tubular axle induction motor (TAIM) where the motor is
mounted directly on the axle shaft. Because of the extreme simplicity of

-2-

the induction motor and the rapid advances made in power semiconductors, it
is most likely to be the prime choice for conventional traction drives in
the future.

2.2. Unconventional Vehicles

Magnetic Levitation (Maglev) research and development are proposed as
a solution to the guidance, support, propulsion, maintenance and environ-
mental problems inevitably created by attempting to run a contact wheel
traction system at very high speeds. The main effort in this area is con-
centrated in Japan and Germany, with lesser effort in the USSR, Canada,
America and the U.K. The sums of development money involved can be enormous
- for example, Japan's Ministry of Transport plans to take over JNR's super-
conducting Maglev project and spend Y100,000m (> £250 million) over the next
six years to have the system fully developed by 1985. In 1979 a plan to
construct a 40 km test track will be financed by a Y10,000m (£25 million)
grant to JNR. In addition the Ministry will also make available Y2,000m
(£50 million) in 1979 to subsidise JAL's attractive Maglev scheme.
Irregardless of whether magnetic suspension is necessary or not, the research
has also established a core of technical knowledge about linear machines of
different types. They can be briefly catagorised as follows:

i) «+ Linear Induction Machines. Initially conceived as a double-sided
machine, usually with a vertical reaction rail, the axial flux, linear
induction machine (AFLIM) has now tended to superseded by the single-sided,
linear induction machine (SSLIM), because of the unattractiveness of feeding
a relatively weakly supported, vertically mounted reaction rail into a
small air gap at high speeds. The LIM tends to have degradation of performance
caused by lateral edge effects, as well as entry and exit edge effects which
in the past have sometimes tended to escape analysis. Because of its induction
effect only small clearances can be allowed in the air gap, otherwise the
powerfactor-efficiency product becomes even more unreasonable. Some relief
of entry and exit losses can be obtained by adopting a transverse-flux mode
of construction, but the machine still relies on induction to establish currents
in the secondary member.

ii) Homo-and Heteropolar machines. These belong to a class of
iron-cored machines which have an a.c. and a d.c. winding on. one member and
rely on track saliency to produce a working thrust. Only small scale testing
(< 100 kW) has been performed on linear and arch motors of this type, which
do seem to have a slight advantage over LIM's.

-3-

iii) Iron-Cored LSM. This alternative, developed mainly by Prof. Weh
at T.U. Braunschweig in West Germany has been adopted by the Transrapid-EMS
group to power the demonstration vehicle being built for IVA-79 at Hamburg.
Although a smal] gap device, with an extended iron-cored track armature
i.e. a long stator, the degradation of eddy current distortion occurring in
the LIM is absent, and the machine is therefore claimed to be much more
efficient and have virtually no degradation with increases in speed. The
short stator LIM has therefore been effectively dropped in Germany as a
propulsion device.

iv) DC Linear Motor. Developed by JNR this machine consists of an
iron-cored field array on the vehicle interacting with track-bound, normal
conducting, air-cored coils. The track coils are switched using a flip-flop
inverter with superforced commutation to provide correct progression of the
armature field The motor has been designed to be used for levitation as well
as propulsion, and does not require superconducting technology for implemen-
tation. The air gap for a 300 km/h system is 157 mm including a 97 mm coil.

v) Air-cored Linear Synchronous Superconducting Machine, LSM. This
LSM design uses high-field superconducting magnets on-board the vehicle to
produce a field variation at the track surface which will interact with the
armature , travelling magnetic wave, generated by a trackbound distribution
of an air-cored winding. The major advantage of this machine over the
induction, d.c. or reluctance machines, is that the majority of air-gap flux
is provided by no expense of reactive power at trackside substations. In
fact, the armature reaction of the machine is relatively small, its amount .
being determined by the traction requirement. In this respect, the machine
differs from an a.c. superconducting generator, where the stator armature
is designed to link as much flux as possible and hence, this results in a
large number of turns per pole per phase. Typical LSM designs go from 1
to 6 full pitch turns per pole per phase, amounting to perhaps 5 - 30 kg
per meter of track length.

All the research so far on these machines has been to develop the
long stator LSM for propelling magnetically levitated vehicles, and so
relatively large gaps (< 0.3 m) have been chosen. Likewise emphasis has
been placed on very lightweight cryostats to house the superconducting
coils. This has led to problems in cryostat design and coil stressing,
some of which would be relieved if a slight weight penalty could be allowed.

3.0. The Intermediate Speed Gap

3.1. Technologies Involved

As mentioned previously the Electromagnetic system of levitation (EMS)
is at the stage of development where passenger-carrying prototypes are about
to be tested. For medium to high speeds the technologies required are not
expected to be overstretched, but for very high speeds reliance must be placed
on tight track tolerances and adequate margins of safety built into levitation
power control systems. With the possible exception of Japan, the Electro-
dynamic system of levitation (EDS) lags behind EMS because of the lead time
of the latter, and also because the technologies involved in large-scale
applications of superconductivity are still in their infancy.

3.2. Hybrid Vehicles

It would appear, therefore, that an important step could be made to
advance both the LSM and advanced transport vehicles, such as APT, by
introducing the concept of a hybrid vehicle> The suspension and guidance
modes of the steel wheel on steel rail would be retained, but the propulsion
would be by the long stator LSM with superconducting magnets on the vehicle.
Conventional railway vehicles would obtain a thrust unit which would not
depend on wheel adhesion for traction and braking and it would require only
minor modifications to track surface. It would remove the need for
pantographs and overhead systems, and it would have an electrical performance
as good as, if not superior, to existing systems. Higher average speeds could
be easily obtained with maximum speeds approaching 350 km/h, although
now the limiting factor would be deceleration rates for passenger comfort
rather than onset of wheel slip. A further advantage would be that a complete
automated train control system is possible from a central computer without
the need to transmit information to and from the train.
4.0. Research Aims and Means of Obtaining Them

4.1. Facilities at Warwick University

Two main test facilities exist at Warwick University and are suitable
for the type of research envisaged, i.e.

/  @ A 550 m straight track, 1.3 m wide, timber construction on
concrete pillars. This facility incorporates a wheeled trolley on which
test vehicles can be mounted and which can be forced down.the track at
speeds up to 45 m/s. The track has been designed to take a deadweight of
~ J tonne and its length could be extended on the campus to include a
switch and curve to a total length of ~ 1 km.

-~5-

* A 3m diameter test wheel. The wheel is entirely non-magnetic,
being constructed from fibreglass/epoxy resin, plywood and aluminium. A
Ward-Leonard drive is provided to allow for a surface speed of 45 m/s. An
additional rim loading of 200 kg (~ 20 kg/m) is possible, without any speed
reduction.
4.2. Existing Research Contracts
Existing SRC contracts to investigate the levitation and propulsion of
high speed vehicles using superconducting magnets are the following: -
1. The influence of ground simulation on the aerodynamics of high speed
trains.
2. A study of the levitation, guidance, and propulsion of an electrodynamic
system of advanced ground transport.
3. The effect of magnetic field oscillations on the losses in supercon-
ducting magnets for application to generators and high speed transport.
A core of expertise and experience on advanced ground transport systems
has been established at Warwick over a number of years and the present team
of Research Fellows and Technician Assistants is well qualified to undertake
this proposed investigation of a LSM propulsion system.
4.3. Objectives of Proposed Research
General: To investigate the application of linear synchronous machines to
advanced ground transport, including their use as a propulsion unit for
wheeled trainsets.
Specific: 1) To extend the work under the present SRC contract on the wheel
testing of the LSM i) to fully investigate "controllability" of synchronous
machines under all likely operating conditions, and ii) to establish the
required amount of feedback required for inverter control and establish the
means of achieving a closed loop operation.

2) To establish experimentally and theoretically the behaviour of
the machine at small air-gaps with high harmonic contents and to formulate
the choices available for guaranteeing adequate ride and phase balance in the
track circuits.

3) To design, commission and operate a scaled version of a LSM
wheeled vehicle with steel rails for guidance.

-6- :

4) To extract from test trials the likely parameters of importance
in designing a full-size system and to establish correlation with theoretical
analysis.

5) To study the design of a full-size prototype vehicle, embodying
current railway practice and the most appropriate choice of cryogenic equip-
ment available.

6) To formulate the requirements of a cryogenic system for
operation in a transport environment.

7) To bring together a core of interested parties in industry and
universities.

4.4. Proposed Strategy
The proposed strategy would fall readily into six parts, i.e.

1) Extend research on the test-wheel by adding a powered winding
and superconducting magnets.

2) Perform further analytical studies to establish primary para-
meters and system sensitivity to changes in these parameters.

3) Perform an outline design for a scaled prototype vehicle.

4) Perform an outline design for a large-scale prototype vehicle

“with track and wheel results as input data.

5) Perform a cost analysis of a complete system.

6) Consider the necessity of constructing a larger scale vehicle.

6.0. Costs Involved
6.1. Definition. of. Areas to be Covered
The research activity splits into four defined categories:
i) Wheel LSM using Liquid Nitrogen (LN, ) cooled coils
ii) Wheel LSM using superconducting coils
iii) Track LSM using LN, cooled coils
iv) Track LSM using superconducting coils
6.2 Wheel Research
6.2.1 Wheel LSM with LN, cooled coils
It is hoped that this activity will be fully met and completed during ;
the existing SRC contract. The major cost of an inverter has been avoided
by the generous loan from Brush of the 375 kVA inverter used on the Mickleover
trials of linear induction machines.
Machine armature design will be checked using ~ 200 kg conductor on the
rim. If more conductor is required, the wheel speed must be derated from
45 m/s. :
6.2.2 Wheel LSM with superconducting coils
Depending on how the LN, coils behave, it would be advantageous to provide
a design case for a superconducting field arrangement. The operational
results would extend the power output of the machine, by increasing the
magnetic loading, and would provide a realistic base for an extrapolated
design of full sized systems. The main problem areas to be expected lie in
coi] stability, low loss coil structures (electrical and thermal), mechanical
integrity under dynamic conditions, and low cost transfer systems (power
- 8 -

and cryogen).

To equip the wheel with a superconducting magnet array would cost
~ £30k, for materials and fabrication labour. Extras for additional
instrumentation and etc. would be minimal. Running costs for helium could
add on another £9k for, say, 10 experimental test runs each requiring 200 1]
helium.

6.3 Track Research .

6.3.1 Common Costs

The natural progression to linear track testing would be necessary to
not only establish the operational constraints of the system, but to
formulate solutions applicable to a full size system.

As a demonstration test bed the track value is hard to assess - but the
first phase (LN. cooled coils) could have a very fast turn-around suitable
for a demonstration facility.

The track installation would require some modification if it was to be
used for major research. The breakdown of these costs are:

£1000's L .
Fencing 2 |
Rough access along track 3 These figures might well
Permanent store/control room 5 be less if, for example,
Trackside distribution 7 second hand equipment was
Guide rails 20 available.
Winding 10
Generatoring set 15
Control gear and electronics 5
£67,000
6.3.2 Track LSM with LN, cooled coils
ee
The expected LN, cooled copper coil cost of fabrication and
commissioning is expected to be about £2,000.

6.3.3 Superconducting Coils

This is a more difficult sum to estimate, but modifying an earlier
quotation obtained from the Rutherford Laboratory, to take inflation into
account, it is expected to be of the order of £60,000 - £70,000.

8. ‘Benefits Resulting from a Cooperative Research Programme
All the participants are likely to achieve benefit from a cooperative
research programme. It is apparent that the future of the railway industry
lies in electrification. Unless the manufacturing groups involved strive
to keep abreast of current technological developments throughout the world,
the situation will arise whereby they have "nothing to offer" to prospective
- 10 -

customers, compared to their competitors. It is worth noting for example
that JNR technical assistance has been southt at near governmental level

in China, Brazil and U.S.A. (in particular the N.E. Corridor Route of New
York, Washington and Boston). Backing up the Japan Railway Technical Service
(JARTS), the JNR and Ministry of Transport Group, is the Japan Rolling

Stock Exporters' Association (JARSEA), whose members include Fuji, Hitachi,
Kawasaki, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Toshiba and others.

Although there are export groups within the U.K., the potential of an
across-industry research activity can only help to strengthen participants’
claims to be in the forefront of the new transportation technologies.
Particular benefits arising from this specific area of research are diffi-
cult to quantify. However, it must be expected that as the programme
progresses patentable areas ranging from, say, cryostat fabrication tech-
niques to machine convertor control strategies will arise which will be of
immediate commercial value to the company involved. Access to the test
facilities will also generate insight into problems encountered in partici-
pants' on-going designs, and provide valuable information ranging from
current collection performance to the aerodynamic characteristics of train

| sets. :

9. Conclusions é

The outcome of a cooperative programme of research would establish
the. aims detailed in 4.3, i.e. to investigate the application of the linear
synchronous machine to advanced ground transport systems as a propulsion
unit for wheeled train sets. :

The research activities will bring immediate and long term benefit to
the participants in terms of patents and test facilities available, as well

as association with a research activity into a new form of transportation
technology.

The cost of the research depends on the final level of commitment.

A low level approach would be achieved with cryogenically cooled superconduct-
ing coils on the wheel and would total £30k plus £9k for helium. An
intermediate stage of nitrogen cooled coils on the track would cost £70k.
To go to superconducting magnets on the track might increase the cost by
another £60k - £70k.
