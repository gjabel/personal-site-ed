Levitation and guidance of high speed vehicles by means of
magnetic forces between superconducting magnets on the vehicle and
eddy currents set up in an aluminium track is described.

Linear motor propulsion is discussed and induction machines are
shown to be incompatible with the levitation. In contrast synchronous
or commutator machines, using the existing mgnets as field excitation,
and with a powered track winding show great promise. In particular the
commutator machine, which has good starting characteristics, will be
studied further.

The test track and research vehicle being built at the University
of Warwick is described briefly.

LEVITATION AND PROPULSION OF GUIDED VEHICLES USING SUPERCONDUCTING
MAGNETS .
E. Abel, A.E. Corbett, B.E. Mulhall, R.G. Rhodes.
Introduction |
Of the several differing strategies being developed to meet future high
speed land transport requirements, the air cushion and magnetic force
suspensions are the main non-contact systems. For both of these linear
electric propulsion is strongly preferred to any form of jet or air
propulsion, for environmental reasons,
The type of levitation involving the repulsion force generated between
superconducting magnets mounted on the moving vehicle and an electrically
conducting (aluminium) guideway is being examined at the University of
Warwick with funding from the Wolfson Foundation. The propulsion unit
should be compatible with a large levitation height, without the need for
a secondary suspension. The possibility of using a machine with a
superconducting field winding on the vehicle and a linear track armature
winding is apparent.
In this paper the general types of machines that may be used for the
propulsion of a magnetically levitated (or Maglev) vehicle are considered,
and the vehicle levitation and guidance characteristics discussed.
Levitation Characteristics
In the proposed Maglev systems the interaction between the guideway eddy
currents and the vehicle magnets results in both lift and drag. ‘These
forces vary with vehicle speed, as sketched in Fig. 1, with the eddy
current skin depth of the metal track determining the scale of the speed
axis(1). Extensive theoretical investigations have resulted in solutions
agreeing closely with experiment for many practical peometries, such as a
rectangular coil moving over a wide track.
No simple expression for the skin depth has been obtained, but for an
aluminium guideway (resistivity about 3 x 10 § 2.m) typical values are
10 - 20 mn. at speeds of 160 m/s. Hence for the situations envisaged, the
very much simpler theory, valid at low speeds will usually be adequate.
It is then found that there is a characteristic velocity, Vo? piven by

Fo» the maximum possible lift force, is approached at high vehicle speeds,
and would be reached for a track with infinite conductivity i.e. a super-
conducting track. The value of F, is determined by suspension height, and
magnet strength and geometry; it is infact just the force between the
vehicle magnets and their identical images reflected in the track.
Guidance Forces
Generally lateral guidance is provided by shaping the guideway, typically
forming it as a channel section (Fig. 2(a)). It is important that the side
flanges be electrically continuous with the track, for otherwise the
vehicle will experience a destabilising lateral force(3). This behaviour
can be simply explained as equivalent to shaded pole action, where the eddy
currents induced in the aluminium are out of phase laterally, and so
provide a lateral linear motor effect.
The vertical guide members can lead to route switching problems in a
transport system, as well as being mechanically restricting. The extra
image magnets created by the lateral guidance forces also produce extra
drag - in fact Davis has shown(2) that equation 1 remins valid if Fe is
replaced by the sum of the lift and guidance forces.
By using the shaded pole action of the edge of an aluminium sheet, flat
track guidance arrangements are possible which provide a magnetic potential
trough for the vehicle. One such scheme is shown in Fig. 2(e). The
requirement of a stabilising force to reduce lateral displacements is ful-
filled simply if the guideway is subjected to a nett flux linkage increase
as the displacement from equilibrium increases. The guidance forces can
be measured on scaled models, by means of inductance measurements, as has
been discussed by Iwasa(4). Iwasa also points out that the full-scale drag
power can also be estimated from loss measurement on the model, though in
practice it may be difficult to make the loss ('Q' factor) measurements
with sufficient accuracy. The tentative results shown in Fig. 3 were
obtained by this method, using a rectangular copper coil placed over two
parallel strips of aluminium.
Track and Magnet Configuration
The split track of Fig. 2(e) appears to have a number of advantages, among
which the more obvious are that it overcomes the mechanical problems of the
channel guideway. It also requires appreciably less track conductor,
perhaps as little as one half, though this is achieved at the expense of
additional superconductor. For the Wolfson test vehicle for example, about
twice as mich superconductor will be needed, but since it will still cost
less than 10% of the track conductor the trade-off is considered to be
worthwhile. A more detailed optimisation will be carried out when the
technical characteristics of the guideway are better understood.
A further advantage is that, since the magnets do not cover the full
width of conducting track, the possibility now exists of combining the

225
lift and propulsion without excessive interaction between track (armature)
winding and the aluminium levitation strips.
A transverse flux arrangement similar to that suggested by Laithwaite and
Eastham for linear induction machines(5) is also being considered, and
appears to have advantages. In the literature on levitation,magnets which
are long in the direction of motion are preferred, as having lower magnetic
drag; then.the lower reluctance of flux paths transverse rather than
along the vehicle would allow some saving on superconductor cost; more
significantly the stray field level in the passenger compartment is
reduced, and screening becomes easier. Thus the arrangement of Fig. 2(f)
is being evaluated.
Propulsion Machine Types
Essentially two main types of motor can be used for high speed transporta-
tion. The linear induction machine (LIM) is well known, and can provide
useful thrust at a slip velocity. The linear synchronous motor (LSM) has
received less attention, and its main drawback is that it cannot provide
thrust for starting unless a variable frequency supply is available. A
third type of machine, the linear commutator motor (LCM) is perhaps an
extension of a LSM with trackside frequency control. Vehicle position
would actuate a switch to energise the appropriate part of the track
winding and produce frequency independent operation. Each machine type
will be considered in turn.
Linear Induction Motor
The LIM has so far appeared in two basic forms for high speed traction.
The double-sided and single-sided motors basically offer performance
similar to their rotating counterparts, but for high speed application the
discontinuity at entry and exit edges, and finite size and isotopy of the
reaction rail, give rise to extra losses and degradation of performance.
An attempt to minimise end effect losses by adding compensating windings
to the main stator block, has met some success(6,7) bringing thrust-slip,
efficiency and power factor nearer to values suggested by an idealized
LIM theory.
In all LIM's, the main stator winding provides the flux which induces eddy
currents in the reaction plate. The machine is typically suitable for
small gap clearances if reasonable power factor and efficiency are to be
obtained. As a propulsion for Maglev vehicles, independent servo-control
of the gap length might be necessary(2), and so the min advantages of the
large gap and tolerance to surface irregularities would be lost.
If the stator unit of a LIM was mounted in the vehicle, this would present
two further problems. The prospect of transferring several megawatts of
power through a current pickup device is daunting although recent develop-
ments appear promising. The weight of the stator itself would reduce the
effective payload of the vehicle, especially if on-board power condition-
ing equipment was included.
The transverse flux motor(5), to some extent, lessens the inherent problem
of high speed operation of a LIM, as the core of the stator now need only
carry tooth flux rather than the whole pole flux of a conventional
machine, and hence the amount of iron can be reduced. Also, core depths

226
are independent of pole pitch with this arrangement. The backing iron
behind the reaction plate of a single-sided LIM can similarly be reduced.
Linear Synchronous Motor
The LSM has no inherent starting thrust, and so a means of providing
propulsive power at essentially zero speed must be found. ‘The normal
methods of using induction starting present grave difficulties as the a.c.
losses in the superconducting winding on the vehicle would be excessive
unless an eddy current screen could be incorporated on the vehicle.
Low frequency starting(8) seems the most viable alternative, and trackside
power conditioning units would be required at the stations to cover their
‘accelerating’ sections of track. Once at a synchronous speed, the LSM
would be operating with track windings at a normal power frequency(9) .
Another method of controlling the synchronous machine is to power the
track in response to a vehicle position signal. The synchronous machine is
then essentially a commutator or d.c. machine, and has the same speed-
torque characteristics with a useful starting torque.
Linear Commutator Motor
As mentioned in connection with the LSM, if track loops are current or
voltage forced in response to vehicle position, a linear commutator machine
(LCM) results. Transverse flux arrangements are still valid, and can
improve overall track efficiency. A solid state device, such as a
thyristor, is the obvious choice for the switching operation, and although
this will inevitably increase the track cost, it is worth noting that over
the last few years thyristor costs have fallen by a factor of six, and
power handling capacity has increased by a factor of 40. For a 30-tonne
revenue vehicle a phase winding made from five turn windings will have a
terminal voltage of about 2kV., and phase current of 1000 amps. For the
Wolfson motor a track thyristor would need to withstand 1kV and pass about
4OO amps.
Large “hockey-puck" thyristors with a high thermal inertia and a rating of
2000 amps r.m.S. or more are now available; the duty cycle imposed by
vehicle headway (on a revenue system) would further ease their rating. As
a rough guide, the cost of thyristors will probably be of the same order
as that of the track conductors.
The system proposed for the Wolfson Maglev Project embodies a LOM, and the
general arrangement might be as in Fig. 4. If the machine begins to fall
out of step with a preprogrammed acceleration routine, position, velocity
and acceleration feedback will enable the thyristor firing rate to be
varied accordingly. Although the thyristor load would have an inductive
component, forced commutation of the device may not be necessary if the
current in the track is controlled, rather than the voltage. A motor
speed control system which embodies this technique is known as the
“controlled current and slip" inverter.
The performance of a LOM is more difficult to assess than a LSM, if a
thyristor commutator is used. A simplified analysis is based on computer
calculations for the mitual inductance of track and vehicle loop arrays,
as vehicle motion proceeds. The relevant forces and couples on the vehicle
can be evaluated, and this gives insight into vehicle dynamic behaviour

227
for various track configurations and excitations. From preliminary
calculations of this type it appears that two main problems will arise.
One concerns the armature reaction on the field winding, since time
varying fields or currents in the superconductor give rise to losses which
may prove unacceptable. Fortunately design studies on rotating super-
conducting machines have shown how eddy current screens can be incorporated
in the machine to alleviate such difficulties. The second concerns the
vertical and lateral forces which the machine produces, and which can be of
the same order as the forces produced by the eddy current levitating inter—
actions. If the forces can be lift and guidance, there exists the prospect
of significant enhancement of the overall performance of the system. How-
ever, the range of geometries for which this desirable state of affairs
occurs is quite limited. Present efforts are directed to studying these
and to ascertaining how stable the resulting dynamic behaviour of the
vehicle would be.
The Wolfson Magnetic Levitation Project
The object of the Wolfson project is to demonstrate the feasibility of
magnetic levitation by superconducting magnets, and to highlight some of
the engineering problems that may be encountered in a revenue vehicle. To
meet these objectives a test track and vehicle will be built and operated
on the Warwick University Campus. A site permitting a straight run of 650m
has been chosen, on which speeds up to 250kn/hr. may be possible. The
track itself will be a flat concrete roadbed, about 1m wide, onto which
the aluminium guideway and armature will be fixed.
A vehicle, 4m long by 1m wide, weighing 600kg and having seating for two
passengers intandem has been designed. Design of the cryostat and the
superconducting coils is also in hand. Preliminary tests will be with the
vehicle coupled to a towed trolley, but later a linear motor of the type
discussed will be fitted as the propulsion unit.
To provide a foundation for the detail design of the suspension and
propulsion theoretical and experimental studies, based on the ideas
discussed on this paper, are being carried out. Models include rotating
drums, the cylindrical surface of which is shaped to simulate a guideway,
and a linear machine which consists of 12 coils (the armature winding)
around the periphery of a 600mm diameter drum. Switching of the linear
machine is by a mechanical commutator, though thyristors will be used at a
later stage. Magnetic excitation is by permanent magnets but since the
fields are too low to give really representative behaviour it is planned
to use a Superconducting magnet at a later stage.
Cone lusion
From the qualitative discussion above it appears that the combination of
levitation and guidance using superconducting magnets above a flat
aluminium track, and propulsion by means of a linear conmutator motor using
the same superconducting magnets for field excitation is possible. Such a
scheme is being considered for land transport at speeds above 300kn/hr.,
and to this end a technical and economic evaluation is in progress.
