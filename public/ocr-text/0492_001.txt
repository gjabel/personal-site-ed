Summary

There is evidence that the human visual system responds
to intermittent illumination at frequencies above those required for
flicker fusion and that flicker can cause the enlargement of high
velocity eye movements, necessitating corrective saccades (Wilkins
1986). AS a consequence, it is possible that an observers performance
of a demanding visual search task will be improved by displaying the
task at an increased field rate even though flicker may be minimised
at conventional field rates by optimising the viewing conditions. For
Surveillance or remote viewing by television this may be important.

The experiment described here measured the speed and
accuracy with which subjects counted the number of circular targets
hidden in a background pattern of random noise, displayed non-
interlaced at field rates of 50, 80 and 100 Hz. There were two parts
to the experiment; the first compared 50 and 80Hz, the second, using a
different display monitor, 50 and 100HzZ. Thus there were two 50Hz
conditions. The displays were viewed under lighting such that flicker
was not noticeable even at 50HZz.

The error rate was found to be constant across’ the
field rates and there was no statistically significant difference in
time taken between 50 and 80Hz. At 100HZ subjects performed slightly
Slower than at 50Hz and the difference was statistically significant.
However this difference was small compared to the difference between
the two 50Hz conditions, which can probably be attributed to a
practise effect rather than any physical difference between the
monitors. The difference between the 50 and 100H2 field rates is
unlikely to be of any practical importance.

When asked, the subjects reported little difference
between the display rates and did not express any preference. Only one
of the subjects reported seeing flicker, even at 50Hz.

The hypothesised effect of display flicker on
performance wasS not confirmed; perhaps the effect of intermittent
illumination is only strong for the highly ordered eye movements
investigated by Wilkins. A second experiment is planned replacing the
visual search task with the reading of text.

1.0 Introduction

CRT based displays are in widespread everyday use, both
in work places and for entertainment. Most use field rates in the
region of 50 to 75 Hz and will often appear to flicker appreciably.
Most people find this annoying and sometimes extremely disturbing.

Flicker can be minimised by careful choice of viewing
conditions and display design (Scheiwiller et al 1988), but there is
evidence that the human visual system responds to the intermittency of
illumination even when no flicker is visible. Tyler (1981) has
recorded electrical activity of the brain synchronous with a display
field scan at frequencies above flicker fusion. Brindley (1962) has
demonstrated the perception of beats between electrical and visual
Stimulation of the eye at frequencies where either stimulus alone
would be invisible. It is possible that these responses have
undesirable effects, and although there is no very good evidence that
the use of CRT displays causes eyestrain or illness, the intermittency
of illumination may be reponsible for the commonly reported finding of
a slower reading speed from a CRT than from a piece of paper (e.g.
Gould and Grischkowsky 1984).

Wilkins (1986) has shown that flicker can cause the
enlargement of saccadic eye movements, the movements made frequently
whilst reading. The extent of the enlargement depends on the display
field rate and is evident when flicker is not noticeable. At 50Hz,
Wilkins found saccades to be 11% larger than at 100Hz. This may
necessitate corrective saccades, which themselves might be enlarged. A
practical implication may be that accurate fixation of the eyes will
be facilitated at a high field rate and a demanding visual search
task, involving many changes of fixation, will be performed more
quickly and possibly more accurately than at a lower field rate. If
the minimum time between saccades is 100msec (Stark et al 1961) then
every ten saccades requiring correction will add 1 second to _ the
search time and produce a measurable difference in performance.

The experiment described here compared observer
performance of such tasks at display rates of 50,80 and 100Hz. The
study is important because a finding of impaired performance at lower
field rates, under viewing conditions where flicker is not apparent,
would indicate that achieving flicker fusion may not be a good enough
criterion for choosing the field rate. |

2.0 Visual Search Tasks

The subjects were asked to find and count the number of
circular targets hidden in a background pattern of random dots. There
were 100 tasks and each contained between 1 and 20 targets. An
example, with 20 targets, is shown in photograph 1. For each number of
targets (1 to 20) there were five patterns, generated by a
Microcomputer and stored on floppy disc prior to the experiment. The
disposition of the targets was randomised over the screen, but care

was taken to ensure that they were evenly distributed between the four
quadrants of the screen and that none were less than two targets-
widths distant from any other. The resolution of the pattern was 256
by 192 pixels and the targets were drawn in cells 8 by 8 pixels. The
background pattern of random dots had approximately equal numbers of
black and white dots and was the same for all 100 tasks.
2.1 Apparatus

The experiment was controlled and timed by a BBC Master
Series microcomputer, which retrieved the appropriate display pattern
from the disc and transferred it as a bit-image, via the user port, to
an Acorn ATOM. The ATOM had been modified in several ways and was able
to generate video signals at field rates nominally of 50,80 and
100HZ. In addition, it was possible to blank and reveal the picture
under program control of the BBC, instantly and without any picture
Gisturbance. This was achieved by switching the output of the ATOM
between the picture signal and a train of syncronising pulses derived
from the picture signal, or vice versa, during the interval between
fields.

The picture was 262 lines, non-interlaced of which 242
lines were active. The actual line and field frequencies for _ the
nominal field rates are shown in table 1. The display had a bright
border which was 25 lines wide at the top and bottom, and the
equivalent of 58 pixels at either side. This was a feature of the
video controller used in the ATOM (Motorola 6847 ) and was unavoidable
in the graphics modes. However under the viewing conditions used for
the experiment, even at 50HzZ, the border did not flicker noticeably.

It was not possible to obtain a picture monitor capable
of displaying 50, 80 and 100HZ, so two monitors were used; a _ BARCO
CD351 to display 50 and 80HZ and a MANITRON VLR20101 for 50 and 100Hz.
The BARCO was a colour monitor with a dot-pitch of 0.32mm and a P22
phosphor, whilst the MANITRON was a high quality black and white
Monitor with a P4 phosphor. Both of these are medium-short persistence
phosphors; figure 1 shows the expected decay curves and Appendix 1
gives the derivation of these curves. The P22 red component has a
longer persistence than the P4, but at the field rates used here the
light output from the excitation of the red phosphor will have decayed
to zero long before the next excitation. The overall flicker waveform,
when the components have been weighted according to the CIE photopic
luminous efficiency curve, is very similar for each monitor.

5

The scan rate of the BARCO monitor was changed by two
internal Switches and re-adjusting the scan geometry controls
(picture height, width, trapezium distortion etc.) The controls were
made accessible from the outside of the monitor by drilling holes in
the backplate, and using test patterns generated by the ATOM, the
correct settings at each scan rate were established. To achieve the
necessary accuracy and repeatability of these adjustments, so that the
picture size and shape did not change each time the field rate was
changed, the position of each control was marked, from a 3.5" pointer
attached to the adjusting screwdriver, onto a paper scale attached to
the monitor backplate. Changing the MANITRON monitor from 50 to 100Hz
was achieved more easily, by swapping the scan control circuit board
with a second, matched board supplied by MANITRON.

2.2 Calibration

Whilst the viewing conditions used in this experiment
were probably not typical of those for CRT displays in everyday use,
they were chosen to minimise the visibility of the picture line
structure which was rather coarse, to make the task suitably
difficult and the picture flicker at 50HZ imperceptible.

a) Room Lighting.

The room lighting was subdued throughout the experiment
and entirely from overhead incandescent lamps; there were no windows.
The illuminance falling on a horizontal surface was 170 Lux where the
Subject waS seated but varied between 160 and 200 Lux for other
locations in the room. There were no obvious reflections from the
monitor screen and glare was minimal.

b) Viewing Distance.

Although both monitors were of 19" diagonal, it was not
possible to arrange for the active picture sizes to be exactly the
same. However by adjusting the viewing distance slightly the pictures
were made to subtend aproximately the same visual angles at the
subjects” eyes. (As the position of the subject’s head was not
constrained there was probably considerably more variation in visual
angle due to the subject moving than to any difference between the
monitors anyway.) For the BARCO, the viewing distance was 160cm and
for the MANITRON monitor 150cm. The actual picture, target and pixel
dimensions are detailed in table 2 with the approximate visual angles
subtended.

c) Monitor Luminance

To ensure that as far as possible, the pictures were of
the same brightness and contrast at the different field rates, the
monitors were set up accurately using an EEL Lightmaster photometer to
measure the light output from the screen. With the meter’s sensor held
against the centre of the screen, and the monitor displaying a black
field, the brightness control was adjusted. To set the white level, a

6

completely white field was displayed and the contrast control
adjusted. For a high quality monitor these adjustments should be
largely independent, but as a small interaction was evident, the
process was repeated until satisfactory readings were obtained. These
are given in table 3.

Strictly, the EEL meter is an instrument for measuring
illuminance, in Lux rather than luminance, in Candela per sq metre,
but by holding the sensor against the screen, which is assumed to be a
Lambertian surface, the relationship is simply:-

L=E/Pi

Where L is the screen luminance in cd/m sq and E is the
illuminance in Lux. (See Appendix 2 for the derivation.)

Later, measurements were made with a MINOLTA spot photometer
to verify the calculations (only the EEL meter was used during the
experiment). These are also included in table 3. The agreement is
fairly good, but using the spot photometer it was discovered that
there were anomolies for each monitor. The BARCO displayed a white
field which was not of uniform luminance over the whole screen; there
was some shading towards the edges, so table 3 includes centre and
edge measurements for the BARCO. (Such measurements were not practical
with the FEL meter.) For the MANITRON monitor, it was found that the
luminance measured from a homogeneous white field was slightly less
than that measured from the white parts of a field made up of black
and white squares; again, details are recorded in table 3. (Perhaps
this effect was due the monitor’s internal power supply being unable
to cope with the sustained high beam current). However it was decided
that these deviations, and their effects on the picture contrast, were
small enough not to influence the results of the experiment.

The contrast inherent in the display can be calculated
from table 3, but the perceived contrast will be modified by the
effect of ambient light reflected from the display screen. Hence,
using the spot photometer, the screen luminance seen from _ the
subjects” view point, under the experimental lighting condition, was
measured. Table 4 shows these results and the display contrast ratio
for a pattern of black and white squares. ( The spot photometer
measurements in table 3 were taken with the room lights off and froma
closer distance to be comparable with the readings taken during the
experiment with the EEL meter.)

d) Display Resolution.

Since the sharpness of the display could affect search
times, the resolution was measured.

The ATOM waS used to generate linear gratings of
different spatial frequencies up to the maximum that was present in
the experimental display, where alternate pixels along a line were on.
As a measure of system response, the luminance modulation of the
display was measured at each frequency. With a close-up lens attached
to the spot photometer it was possible to measure the luminance of an

7

area 0.4 mm in diameter, so even at the highest spatial frequency the
modulation could be found by measuring the luminance of the black and
white bars of the grating. The modulation is then defined as:-

M=(L -L ) / (L +L )

w b w b
Where L is the luminance of the white bars and
Ww
L is the luminance of the black bars.
b

The results for the four display conditions are
plotted in figure 2. Each point is a single measurement and_ the
spatial frequencies are expressed in cycles per degree of visual
angle from the subjects point of view.

Comparison with the modulation sensitivity functions
of the human visual system puts the differences between monitors and
between field rates into perspective. Figure 3 shows the sensitivity
functions obtained by Van Meeteren and Vos (1972) for a field, 17 by
11 degrees of visual angle. Sensitivity is defined as the reciprocal
of the modulation for which subjects would see, with a probability of
0.75, a grating rather than a uniform grey field. The solid curves are
therefore boundaries between seeing a grating and a uniform field. The
reciprocal of the modulation measured from the MANITRON monitor at 100
Hz (which can be seen from figure 2 to be the worst case) is plotted
to the same scale. The mean luminance used here is about 27 cd/sq m so
the modulation of the display, at the highest spatial frequency, is at
least 200 times greater than at threshold. Compared to the
degradation of resolution that would be necessary to make the task
impossible (a factor of about 200), the difference between monitors
seems negligible.

2.3 Experimental Design.

As the MANITRON picture monitor was not initially
available, the experiment was in two parts; the first compared
performance of the search task at field rates of 50 and 80HzZ, using
the BARCO monitor, whilst the second, one month later compared 50 and
100HZ using the MANITRON. It was expected that the two 50Hz conditions
would give a sufficiently similar baseline for the comparison of 80
and 100HzZ to be legitimately drawn, and if not it would still be of
interest to see whether any differences found in the first part were
replicated in the second.

In each sub-experiment the subjects were divided at
random into two groups (5 per group). Each subject attended two
sessions and completed all 100 search tasks in each. The first of
these groups saw the higher field rate in their first session and the
lower rate in their second, whilst the second group saw the lower
field rate first, and the higher rate second.

8

Each part of the experiment was timetabled in a _ way
such that, as far as possible, the two sessions for each subject were
at the same time on consecutive days. No subject did both sessions on
the same day, but one in the first part of the experiment had a days
break between the first and second sessions. Most of the subjects took
about 50 minutes for a session, but the best performers took about 30
mins, and the slowest around 75 minutes.

2.4 Experimental Procedure

The subject was, for the first half of the experiment,
seated on a stool, but by popular demand on a more comfortable
draughtman’s swivel chair, with a backrest, for the remainder. The
subjects” eyelevel, when seated, was about 145cm, depending on posture
and stature, and was slightly higher than the centre line of the
monitor at 125cm. Meanwhile the experimenter sat some way behind the
subject facing a display connected to the BBC computer. On this was
displayed the test pattern, the task number, the correct answer, and
any responses the subject had made.

A high quality television camera was set up,
unobtrusively, about 40 degrees off-axis slightly behind the subjects”
monitor. This enabled the experimenter to see, from a monitor on his
bench, that the subject was looking at the task and answering
conscientiously. (See photograph 2.)

A session was started by the subject, seated in front
of the the display monitor, pressing the space bar of the computer
keyboard. The instructions (see Appendix 3) were then displayed page
by page on the monitor as black characters on a bright background. To
display the next page, the subject pressed the space bar. In short the
subjects were instructed to count the targets as quickly and as
accurately as possible.

Next, five practise trials were presented for
familiarisation with the procedure, but from which no data were
recorded. After these the subject was given the choice of repeating
the instructions and practise trials, repeating the practise trials
alone or proceeding with the experiment. None of the subjects repeated
the instructions or practise, except by accident. Up to this point the
experiment took about 5 minutes, and it was assumed that the subjects”
eyes would by now be adequately adapted to the room lighting.

This was followed by presentation of the 100 search
tasks. The order of tasks was always the same; a pseudo-random
sequence such that no consecutive tasks had the same number of
targets. A trial commenced with the screen blanked (i.e. black) whilst
the BBC transferred the display pattern to the ATOM. After about 3
seconds the display was revealed and the subject began to count the
number of targets. When he had an answer he pressed the space bar and
the screen was again blanked. Half a second later he was prompted, on
the screen, for the number of targets. The answer was entered via the
numeric keypad of the computer and echoed to the screen. As this echo
required a transfer of data between the BBC and the ATOM, there was a

9

small delay between pressing a key and the number appearing on_ the
screen. Initially this caused some problems for one or two of the
subjects but these were quickly overcome during the practise trials
and the delay was easily accepted. The answer was checked to see if it
was a number between 1 and 20. If not, the subject was reminded that
the answer should be in this range and prompted to re-enter the
number.

If the answer was correct, the screen was blanked and
the next task presented. However, if the subject had answered
incorrectly he was informed thus and the task was repeated. A maximum
of three attempts was allowed for each task (although the subjects did
not know this) and if the third attempt was unsuccessful the
experiment proceded as if the answer had been correct. If, by accident
a subject had entered a number he did not intend which was
nevertheless a valid answer (e.g 9 instead of 19) he was instructed to
tell the experimenter, who made a note of the trial number, so that
the error could be corrected later.

The computer recorded, for each task, the number of
attempts taken, the time (in centiseconds) for which the task had
been displayed and, right or wrong, the subject’s actual answer. When
all 100 tasks had been presented the subject was briefly asked
whether he had noticed flicker in the display and for any comments.
After the second session he was also asked whether he had found the
session easier than the first, and whether he felt that the picture
had been clearer, brighter or no different than before.

2.5 Subjects

Twelve male subjects participated in the experiments;
there were 10 per sub-experiment (5 in each group ) and eight were
common to both parts. None were frequent VDU users, but all watched
television. By profession, they were technicians, craftsmen or
engineers (staff at UKAEA Harwell), aged between 22 and 36 years, with
a median age of 24 years. Within the last three years each had been
ophthalmically screened and with one exception had 6/6 or better
visual acuity with spectacle correction if worn. The exception had 6/9
acuity in his right eye and 6/4 in his left. All were naive as to the
purpose of the experiment.

The two subjects new to the second part of the
experiment were put in different groups; one saw the 50Hz field rate
in his first session, the other, 100Hz.

3.0 Results, Analysis and Discussion

The data were corrected where subjects had
inadvertently entered the wrong answers, and then uploaded to the
mainframe computer at University College London, where the following
analyses were carried out, mainly using the BMDP package of
statistical software.

10

3.1 Error Rate

In drawing any conclusions from the comparison of
response times it is important to take into account the error rate (or
indeed the response times when considering error rates). It is
possible that subjects trade-off accuracy for a fast performance or
vice-versa (Pachella 1974) and therefore a quantitative comparison of
response times where the error rate does not remain constant can be
misleading since two qualitatively different performances are being
compared (slow and accurate vs. fast but inaccurate).

Essentially, the data were analysed with a _ two-way
analysis of variance of the number of errors made, with field rate and
the number of targets presented. This was done both for the total
number of errors, (the number of incorrect answers on attempts 1,2 and
3) and for the number of errors made at the first attempt.

For the first part of the experiment, 50 vs 80 Hz with
the BARCO monitor, the total number of errors is plotted in fig. 4
against number of targets. Similarly fig. 5 shows the number of
errors made in the second part (50 vs. 100 Hz). The analysis of
variance showed that there was no statistically significant difference
in the total number of errors between any of the field rates but, as
expected, the number of targets was significant (F(19,3920)=12.31;
p<0.0001 Table A4.1). There was no significant interaction between
these two factors. Analysis of the number of errors at the first
attempt was very Similar (Table A4.2). It is therefore legitimate to
compare subject performance by comparing response times.

3.2 Response Times.

Although more of the data collected could have been
utilised, only the response time for the first attempt at a task has
been used. It is possible that spurious results might have been
introduced using the second and third attempts, where subjects may
have reasoned their answer could not have been wrong by more than one
or two and simply adjusted their first answer.

The response times were examined by calculating the
linear regression of mean response time on the number of targets
presented (see table A4.12 for a summary of the coefficients). Linear
regression was used for both ad hoc and a priori reasons. First,
because it is a simple model which fits the data well (typically
explaining about 85% of the variance), and second because’ response
time might reasonably be expected to vary in an approximately linear
way with number of targets presented. For each trial, there will bea
component of response time due to searching the display, a component
due to "registering" each target (to fixate and count a target ) anda
component due to pressing the space bar. Whilst it is difficult to
know exactly what cognitive processes are involved with each
component, it is reasonable to suppose that the first and third will
be largely independent of the number of targets and that the second
will be related proportionally. Hence a linear relationship, with a
non-zero intercept is to be expected (perhaps with some deviation for

ll

the case of 20 targets, where the search need not be exhaustive; once
20 targets have been found there is no need to look for any more). The
hypothesised effect of picture flicker could affect either or both of
the first two components and hence be manifest as a change of gradient
(B in table A4.12) or both intercept (A in table A4.12) and gradient.

If the residual variance, ie. the variance not
explained by the regression, was significantly reduced by
partitioning the data in some way (e.g. by field rate) and fitting a
linear regression, in turn, to the data on each side of the partition,
then these linear regressions would be Significantly different, in
gradient, intercept or _ both.

Fig.6 show the results for the first Part of the
experiment. Each point is the mean of 5 trial by 10 subjects and the
error bars are plus or minus one standard error of the mean.
Similarly, fig.7 shows the results for the second part; 50 vs 100 Hz
with the MANITRON monitor. The following Significant differences were
found:-

Monitor Difference p value
BARCO 50Hz vs. BARCO 80Hz 50HZ Slightly faster n.s.
MANITRON 50HZ vs. MANITRON 100Hz 50HZ slightly faster p=0.0065
BARCO 50Hz VS. MANITRON 50HzZ MANITRON faster p<0.0001
BARCO 80HZ VS. MANITRON 100Hz MANITRON faster p<0.0001
(See Tables A4.3, A4.4 and A4.5 for analysis of variance tables for
Significant results.)

The gradient of the regression for the MANITRON at 50Hz
did not differ significantly from that at 100Hz (Table A4.6), whilst
for the other two significant comparisons the slope was different.
(F(1,1996)=16.11, p=0.0001, table A4.7 and F(1,1996)=8.66, p=0.0033,
table A4.8 respectively).

The differences between the regressions are reflected
in the overall mean response times (10 subjects; 100 tasks):-

Monitor Mean Response Time (Sec) Standard Deviation
BARCO 50HZ 10.67 6.78
BARCO 80Hz 11.09 6.45
MANITRON 50Hz 8.89 4.58
MANITRON 100Hz 9.45 5.07

12

From this it is evident that the difference between the
two field rates of the MANITRON monitor was quite small and, by
comparison with the difference between the two 50Hz conditions, is
probably of no practical consequence.

3.3 Possible Effect of Learning.

The large difference between the two parts of the
experiment was unexpected and because of the experimental design, it
is not possible to say whether this is due to physical differences
between the monitors, or can be entirely explained by a practise
effect. Eight of the subjects were common to both parts, and _ had
already completed two sessions before starting the second part.

a) Error Rate

For these eight subjects the error rate (all attempts)
was not constant across the sessions (F(3,3120)=5.13, p=0.001; table
A4.9). A Newman-Keuls analysis (table A4.10) showed that for session 4
the rate was no different from session 1, sessions 2 and 3 were not
Significantly different from each other but differed from sessions ]
and 4. Session 3 and 4 are respectively, the first and second sessions
of part 2.

b) Response Times

The regressions of mean response time on number of
targets for these eight subjects are plotted session by session in
figure 8. The ordering of the lines is certainly consistent with a
practise effect; the line for each session lies below that of the
previous session and their disposition may well be enough to explain
the difference between parts 1 and 2: 80% of the data for the results
in fig.6 are drawn from session 1 and 2 of fig.8, and 80% in fig.7 are
drawn from session 3 and session 4.

Since the error rate changes from session to session a
quantitative comparison of the regressions is dubious, but with
practise it might be expected that subjects will perform more quickly,
more accurately, or both at each successive session. For the first
three sessions this was true:- session 2 was faster and more
accurate than session 1; session 3 was faster than session 2 for the
Same accuracy, but for session 4 there was a different speed-accuracy
trade-off; session 4 was the fastest of the 4 sessions, but only as
accurate as session l.

Session Mean Response Time Standard Deviation No. of Errors
1 11.93 6.79 111
2 10.33 5.88 72
3 9.51 4.89 75
4 8.65 4.87 107
13

This suggests that practise explains the difference
between the first three sessions and probably the difference between
the two parts of the experiment, but after three sessions has little
further effect.

c) New Subjects

If this explanation is correct, then the two subjects
new to the second part, might be expected to have performed in a
Similar way to the ten subjects in part l.

The error rate (all attempts) for these two subjects,
at 50 and 100 Hz was not significantly different from elsewhere in the
experiment and there was no interaction with the number of targets.

At 100 Hz, the regression was not significantly
different from that at 80Hz in part 1, whereas the regression for all
the subjects at 100 Hz differed. However at 50 Hz the regression for
the new subjects differed significantly from 50 Hz in part 1
(F(2,1196)=14.91, p<0.0001; table A4.11) but not from the rest of the
subjects in part 2 at 50Hz. Since the higher field rate argues that
these two subjects perform in a similar manner to those in part 1, and
the lower field rate that they perform like those in part 2, no
conclusion can be drawn from this.

Session by session, the error rate for the new subjects
(all attempts) did not differ significantly between session Il,
session 2, and the error rate of the eight common subjects in their
third session. There was no interaction with number of targets in
either case.

The regression for the new subjects” second session
was not significantly different from the old subjects” fourth
session, whilst the regression line for the new subjects” first
session lay between the old subjects” first and second sessions.
Therefore the two new subjects started off slower and less accurately
than the rest in part 2, but by session 2 appear to performed at the
same speed but more accurately than the other 8. This supports a
practise effect, but these two subjects learnt quickly and appear to
have been particularly good at the task.

3.4 Subject Comments

When the subjects were asked for their comments at the
end of each session, none spontaneously mentioned display flicker.
Even when asked specifically, only one had noticed any. This subject
was one of the eight who participated in both parts of the experiment
and after both of the 50Hz sessions reported seeing flicker. In the
first part he thought that both sessions were of about equal
difficulty, whereas in the second he thought 50Hz the more
difficult. However the data from this subject suggest that, in fact,
he searched more quickly and more accurately at 50Hz, but as he was in
group 1, which saw 50Hz second, for both parts of the experiment, this
could just be the effect of practise.

14

In the first part, all but one of the subjects thought,
either that the second session was easier than the first or that they
were of equal difficulty. Interestingly, in the second part, whilst
the two new subjects found the second session easier, only one of the
other subjects thought the second to be the easier session. This
supports the practise effect suggested above. Table 5 shows’ these
opinions arranged by field rate, and although the numbers are _ too
small for any reliable statistics to be performed there is no evidence
to suggest that the higher field rates were preferred.

Similarly, table 6 and 7. show the subjects” opinions
as to which of the displays was the “clearer” and which if either was
the brighter. “Clearer” meant a subject had commented that in some
way the targets were easier to see, and in one case that the display
had more contrast. Again , because of the small number of observation
and the informal nature of the comparison, it is not possible to read
very much into this, but it appears that the slight differences in
display resolution were not conspicuous.

15

4.0 Conclusions

The hypothesised effect of display flicker is not
confirmed; there is no evidence from this experiment that subjects
performed a demanding visual search task with increased speed or
accuracy at display field rates higher than 50Hz.

It is possible that the effects of flicker found by
Wilkins are only pronounced for the highly ordered, predictable eye
movements found in reading rather than the more erratic ones likely to
be found in the search tasks used here. A second experiment is planned
where subjects will be required to read text displayed at either 50 or
100HZ.

Curiously, performance at 100HzZ was slightly Slower than
at 50Hz and the difference was statistically significant.
Measurements of the display resolution suggest that there was a small
difference in sharpness, 100HZ being slightly less sharp than 50Hz,
but it was certainly not the case that the smallest details of the
task could be seen at one field rate and not the other. A Side by
side comparison was not possible, but none of the subjects remarked
that the 100HzZ display was less sharp than any other. In addition the
regressions calculated for mean response time on the number of targets
did not differ in slope between these two field rates. This would not
be expected if degradation of the display was the reason for the 50HzZ-
100Hz difference. Therefore it is unlikely that a change in resolution
is the explanation.

There waS a statistically significant difference
between the two parts of the experiment. This is most plausibly
explained by a practise effect rather than any physical difference
between the monitors. Compared to this, the difference between 50 and
100HZ is small, and therefore of little practical consequence.

Although the comparisons were not rigorous, the
subjects did not think any field rate easier than any others and on
the whole noticed little difference between any of the display
conditions.

Appendix 1

Explanation of the derivation of the phosphor decay
curves of figure l.

P22 is a set of coloured phosphors; red, green and
blue. P4 is a white phosphor, but has two components, blue and yellow.
For the P22 and P4 phosphors the decay times to 10% brightness are as
follows (JEDEC):-

‘ P4 yellow component 60 usec
P4 blue component 20 usec
P22 blue 40 usec
P22 green 40 usec
P22 red 1 msec

It is assumed that the light output decays
exponentially with time after excitation. If the output is measured
relative to the peak value, the decay has the form:-

-kt
L(t) = e Where t is the time in usec, L is the
relative light output and k the decay
constant.

Setting L = 0.1 and t = the persistence tabled above,

the decay constants are:-
P4 blue component 0.115
P4 yellow component 0.038
P22 green and blue 0.058
P22 red 0.002

These are the P22 red and P22 green & blue curves
plotted in figure 2. However, so that they can be plotted on the same
graph, a logarithmic time scale is used.

To estimate a total decay curve for the P22 phosphor,
when the colour white is displayed, the curve from each colour
component is weighted by the CIE Photopic Luminous Efficiency
Function. ( Which is essentially a plot of the relative response of a
normal human eye to monochromatic light at different spectral
wavelengths.)

i

For the P22 phosphors the principal spectral peaks are
(JEDEC):-
Red 630 (nm)
Green 516 (nm)
Blue 450 (nm)
Figure Al shows these points on the luminous efficiency
curve, and hence the equation for the decay curve is:-
L (t) = 1.075 (0.265 L (t) + 0.627 L (t)
tot red green
+ 0.038 L (t) )
blue
The factor of 1.075 is to make the total output equal
to 1 when L Let and L all equal 1. This is the
red green blue
curve labelled “P22 White’, in figure 2.
Similarly, for the P4 phosphor the principal spectral
peaks are:-
Yellow component 560 (nm)
Blue component 460 (nm)
Weighted by the photopic luminosity function, the decay
curve is:-
L (t) = 0.947 (0.995 L (t) + 0.060 L (t))
tot Yellow blue
This is the curve labelled “Pp4 White” in figure 2.

Appendix 2
Derivation of the relationship between luminance and
illuminance for a non-absorbing Lambertian surface.

A Lambertian surface is one which appears to be of
equal luminance from all directions. For instance a
plane mirror illuminated with a collimated light source
would not be Lambertian, but a self-luminant surface,
such as a CRT face, would be.

Luminous flux (F) measured in Lumen, is a measure
of the amount of light emitted, received, or transmitted
per second.

Luminous intensity (I), measured in Candela (cd),
is a measure of the illuminating power of a light
source. For a point source, luminous intensity in a
given direction is equal to the luminous flux emitted,
in that direction per steradian. ( The steradian is a
unit of solid angle, such that 1 steradian is the solid
angle subtended at the centre of a sphere by an area on
the surface equal to that of a square with sides equal
to the sphere’s radius.)

Hence:-

I=F/w Where w is the solid angle
subtended.

The illuminance (E) of a surface is a measure of
the luminous flux (F) falling on the surface per unit
area. The unit is Lux, and 1 Lux equals 1 Lumen/ sq
metre.

For a surface of area A, distant d from a point
source:-

2
E= F/A = I/d Lux
or if the light source is at an angle of @
to the normal to the surface:-
2
E = (I Cos @)/d
This result is known as the cosine law of
illumination.

The luminance (L) is a measure of the luminous flux
per unit solid angle, per unit projected area, in a
particular direction at a point on the surface. The unit
is candela per square metre and :-

2

L = I/A cd/m Where A is the area projected

in the specified direction
iii

If the luminous flux emitted from a surface, ina
direction @ to normal to the surface, varies in
proportion to Cos 6, then the surface is Lambertian as
the area projected in the direction of 6 also varies
with Cos @. ;

If such a surface has an illuminance of E Lux and
is non-absorbing, then a small element of the surface,
ds, will emit a luminous flux of:-

E.ds Lumen into a hemisphere (see fig A2).
2

If the surface luminance is L cd/m, then the

element will have a luminous intensity of:-
L.ds cd normal to the surface.

This element, by itself illuminates a hemisphere of
radius r (fig. A2). An elemental ring on the surface, at
an angle @6 to the normal has a width of r.d@ and a
circumference of 2t r.Sin ©. The solid angle subtended
is:-

2 2 2
w= Area/r = (2Trr Sin © dé@)/r
= 27TTSin @.d6e6
The ring is subject to luminous intensity of:-
L.ds.Cos @ cd
The elemental luminous flux is then:-
aF = Iw = 211L.ds.Cos 6 Sin 6.de
The flux emitted into the whole cone of semi-
vertical angle © is:-
e
F - | 2™7L.ds.Cos @ Sin @.dée
° 2
= TWL.ds.Sin 6 Lumen
For the whole hemisphere 6=T /2 radians so _ the
total flux due to area ds is:-
F = 7L.ds Lumens
But this also equals E.ds, hence:-
2
L = E/tr cd/m

Appendix 3
Text of the instructions given to the subjects.

The instructions were presented as several screens of
text, each ending with the line " Press space bar to continue......”.
When the subject responded, the screen was cleared and the next
section displayed; thus the rate of presentation was paced by the
subject.

Instructions
In this experiment you are required to
count the number of "targets" hidden in
a background pattern.
A "target" looks like this:-
Oo
Press space bar to continue.............
Each screen will contain between 1 and
20 "targets". You are asked to count the
"targets" AS QUICKLY AND AS ACCURATELY
AS POSSIBLE.
Press space bar to Continue... ..eeeveves
When you are satisfied that you have
found all the "targets" press the space
bar. The screen will go blank, and
shortly afterwards you will be asked to
enter the number you have counted.
Press space bar to continue.......ceeeee
Enter your answer using the _ key-pad;
then press RETURN. There is a_ small
delay between pressing a key and the
number appearing on the screen.
Press space bar to continue......cceeeee
V

If you have made an error in entering
your answer and have not yet pressed
RETURN, simply enter any letter before
pressing RETURN. You will then be
prompted to re-enter your answer.
However, if you have already pressed
RETURN then tell the experimenter.
Press space bar to continue.........cc0.
If the answer you have entered is
correct, then after a short pause the
next test will be presented.
If you have answered incorrectly you
will be informed and asked to repeat
the count.
Press space bar to continue.....csceeees
There are 100 such tests’ and the
experiment usually takes about 1 hour.
Before starting press either the space
bar to repeat these instructions or
press RETURN to run some practise tests.
