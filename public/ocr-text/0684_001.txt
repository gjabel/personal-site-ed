A manipulator
This invention relates to a manipulator for the remote
handling of an object, for example an object in a radioactive
environment. Although numerous manipulator designs have been
5 developed over the years, many of them are relatively complex
and expensive, and there is still a need for a relatively
simple design of manipulator which is comparatively
inexpensive for performing relatively light remote handling
operations.

10 The invention therefore provides a manipulator for
remote handling of an object, the manipulator being capable
of pivotal movements, and having at least one of the pivotal
movements thereof controlled by a flexible shaft means
rotatably extending in a flexible conduit.

15 Preferably, the flexible shaft means is controlled by
electric motor means, for example servo or stepping motor
means.

Desirably, at least one of the flexible shaft means is
connected to a worm gear meshed with a worm gear wheel, the

20 worm gear wheel being arranged to turn on the pivotal axis of
the respective pivotal movement so as to effect the pivotal
movement.

The manipulator of the invention may incorporate a jaw
assembly comprising, opposing jaw members each locating, at

25 one end thereof, one end of a respective bell crank lever,
each lever having the other end thereof located in a grooved
member arranged to be displaced by screw thread means so as

to pivot the levers. Preferably, the jaw members locate in a
common groove extending transverse to the displacement of the

30 grooved member so that pivotal movement of the levers
displaces the jaw members along the groove.

The invention will now be further described by way of

-2-=
example only with reference to the accompanying drawings in ;
which:- ,
Figures la and lb show complementary partly broken away
side views of a manipulator;
5 Figure le shows a fragmentary view in the direction of
arrow 'A" of Figure la; ;
Figure 2 shows a view on the line II-II of Figure 1b;
; Figure 3 shows a view on the line III-III of
Figures la and lb;
- 10 Figure 4 shows a fragmentary partly broken away view of
a modified form of the manipulator of .
Figures la and lb; and
Figure 5 shows a view on the line V-V of Figure 4.
Referring now to Figures la to 3, a manipulator 10 for
15 relatively light operations is shown and comprises, a base
unit 12, an upper arm 14, a forearm 16, and a wrist assembly
18 on which is mounted a head assembly 20.
The base unit 12 comprises a proprietary rotary table *
unit 26 actuated by an electric motor 27 and which comprises
20 a stationary base 28 and a rotary table 29 on which is :
secured a motor in the form of a combined electric stepping .
motor/gearbox assembly 30. Two side plates 34, 36
respectively mounted on the rotary table 29 are spaced apart
by a block 38 secured to the rotary table 29 and joined
25 together by screws 39, and provide respective housings 40 for
bearings 42 which locate a respective end of a shaft 44 to
which a truncated worm gear wheel 46 is secured. A worm gear
49 in engagement with the worm gear wheel 46 is located in

-3- ‘
bearings 53, 55 in the block 38, and at one end is joined to
a coupling 58 mounted on a shaft 59 of the stepping
motor/gearbox assembly 30.
A flat upper arm member 64 of the upper arm 14 has a .
5 rounded end 65 secured to the worm gear wheel 46 by screws
66, and supports four motors in the form of electric stepping
; motor/gearbox assemblies 67, 68, 69, 70 respectively each
secured to the upper arm member 64 by a respective clamp
fitting 72 with the exception of the stepping motor 67 which
10 is secured to a spacer 71 itself secured to the upper arm
member 64, the stepping motor/gearbox assemblies 67, 68 being
| mounted on one side of the upper arm member 64 and the
stepping motor/gearbox assemblies 69, 70 being mounted on the
other side thereof. The stepping motor gearbox assembly 68
15 is arranged to drive a shaft 74 through a coupling 58, the
shaft 74 extending to a worm gear 76 mqunted in bearings 77,
78 in a block 79 in a similar manner to that described in
relation to the worm gear 49. The block 79 is sandwiched
between the upper arm member 64 and a side plate 82 and
20 secured thereto by screws 83. A worm gear wheel 85 meshed
with the worm gear 76 is secured to a shaft 86 mounted at
each end in a flanged bearing 87 located in a housing 88 in
the side plate 82 and in the upper arm member 64
respectively, and a flat forearm member 91 stiffened by a web
25 93 has an enlarged and rounded end 92 secured to the worm
gear wheel 85 by screws (not shown), an annular spacer 94
being mounted on the shaft 86 between the upper arm member 64
and the flat forearm member 91.
At the other end of the forearm member 91, a worm gear
30 wheel 102 is secured to a shaft 104 mounted in respective
bearings 106 (only one is shown) located in a housing 107 in
a side plate 108 and (not shown) in the forearm member 91, an
annular spacer 109 being between the worm gear wheel 102 and
the side plate 108. A block 110 is sandwiched between the
35 side plate 108 and the forearm'member 91 and secured thereto

- 4-
by screws 112. A worm gear 114 meshed with the worm gear
‘wheel 102 locates in respective bearings 116, 117 in the
block 110, and extends to a coupling 119 connecting the worm
gear 114 to one end of a flexible shaft 121 in a flexible
5 conduit 123, the conduit 123 being held by a clamp unit 125
against a support arm 127 secured to the forearm member 91 by .
screws 129. -The other end of the flexible shaft 121 is
connected by a coupling 58 to the stepping motor 67, the :
other end of the conduit 123 being held by a clamp unit 132
10 against the spacer 71.
A shaped mounting 134 secured to the worm gear wheel 102
is shown partially cut away and has a cylindrical hole 136 to
locate as a clearance fit a shouldered screw 138 which
extends through a bevel gear wheel 140 to locate in a
15 threaded hole 142 in a mounting block 144 of the head
assembly 20 to which the bevel gear wheel 140 is secured. A
support 148 is secured to one side of the shaped mounting
134, and a shaft 150 has one end located as a clearance fit
in a cylindrical hole 152 in the shaped mounting 134 and has
20 the other end thereof extending through a bearing 154 in the
support 148 to a coupling 155. A bevel gear 156 meshed with
the bevel gear wheel 140 is secured to the shaft 150, and the
coupling 155 is connected to one end of a flexible shaft 158
located in a flexible conduit 160 held by a clamp unit 161 to
25 the support 148. The other end of the flexible shaft 158 is :
connected by a coupling 58 to the’ stepping motor/gearbox
assembly 70, the other end of the conduit 160 being held by a
clamp unit 162 attached to the upper arm member 64.
A bracket 166 extending from the mounting block 144
30 incorporates a clamp unit 168 for holding one end of a .
flexible conduit 171 through which a flexible shaft 173
extends to a coupling 175, the other end of the flexible
+ shaft 173 being connected to the stepping motor/ gearbox
assembly 69 and the other end of the conduit 171

-§.
being held by a clamp unit 177. A rod 179 extends through a
bearing 182 in a housing 183 in the mounting block 144, and
has one end connected to the coupling 175. A spur gear
pinion 185 is mounted on the other end of the rod 179 and
5S meshes with a spur gear wheel 187 integral with a rotatable
, beak assembly 189 of the head assembly 20, the beak assembly
189 having a hollow shaft portion 192 which extends through a
/ bearing 194 in a housing 196 in the mounting block 144 and is
retained therein by a washer 197 and a nut 198 which is
10 engaged with a threaded spigot 199 at the end of the hollow
shaft portion 192. An upper housing portion 204 and a lower
_ housing portion 206 of the beak assembly 189 are secured
together at respective flanges 208, 209. Inside the upper
housing portion 204 a direct current electric motor 212 is
15 located and is arranged to be energised through an electric
cable 214 extending through an axial aperture 216 which
extends through the upper housing portion 204, the hollow
shaft portion 192, and the threaded spigot 199. A coupling
218 is mounted on a drive shaft 230 of the electric motor
20 212, and is internally threaded at one end 232 to engage a
threaded rod 234 extending from a jaw assembly 236, a flat
head 238 of the rod 234 having a transverse slot 240 at one
side thereof in which locate rounded ends 242 of left hand
and right hand bell crank levers 244, 245 respectively.
25 Rounded ends 251 at the other ends of the bell crank levers
‘ 244, 245 locate in a groove 252 in a respective jaw member
254, the jaw member 254 having as shown in Figure le a
° rectangular section slider portion 256 at one end of a finger
portion 257 thereof and locating in opposing transverse
30 grooves 258a, 258b in flat body members 249, 250 respectively
in which the bell crank levers 244, 245 pivotally locate.
| In operation, on the stepping motor/gearbox assembly 30
being energised, the action of the worm gear 49 turns the
worm gear wheel 46 and causes pivotal movement of the upper
35 arm member 64. Energisation of the stepping motor/gearbox
assembly 68 rotates the shaft 74 and thus rotates the worm

- 6 -
gear 76 which turns the worm gear wheel 85 causing pivotal
movement of the forearm member 91. When the stepping
motor/gearbox assembly 67 is energised, it rotates the
flexible shaft 121 and thus rotates the worm gear 114 which
5 turns the worm gear wheel 102 causing pivotal movement of the
shaped mounting 134. Energisation of the stepping
motor/gearbox assembly 70 rotates the flexible shaft 158 and °
thus the bevel gear 156 which turns the bevel gear wheel 140
and with it the mounting block 144. On the stepping |
10 motor/gearbox assembly 69 being energised, it rotates the
, flexible shaft 173 and thus the pinion 185 which turns the
gear wheel 187 and causes corresponding rotation of the beak
assembly 189. Energisation of the electric motor 212 rotates
the coupling 218 about the threaded rod 234 causing linear
15 displacement of the threaded rod 234 and thus pivotal
movement of the bell crank levers 244, 245 with corresponding
transverse linear displacement of the jaw members 254.
The stepping motor/gearbox assemblies 67, 68, 69 and 70,
and the electric motor 212 may be controlled in a
20 conventional manner, or may be incorporated in a master
switching arrangement operated by movements corresponding to
the required movements of the manipulator 10, an example of
such a switching arrangement being shown in co-pending patent
application No 8029136.
25 If desired, a pivotal movement of the manipulator 10 may
be effected by an alternative arrangement, for example as ‘
shown in Figures 4 and 5, and referring to Figure 4, a wrist
assembly 18a is shown of a manipulator 10a similar in most
respects to the manipulator 10 of Figures la to 3 but having
30 an alternative arrangement for pivoting a mounting block 144a
which is identical to the mounting block 144 of Figure la
except for the manner in which it is pivotally attached to
the wrist assembly 18a. At the wrist assembly 18a, an
inclined T-shaped mounting 284 replaces the shaped

- 7 =
mounting 134 of Figure la, and has a mounting face 286
defining an aperture 287 in which a flanged bearing 289
locates. A shouldered screw 288 extends through the bearing
289 and a worm gear wheel 290 with a central hole 292 is
5 mounted on the screw 288 and secured by several screws 294
. (only two are shown) to the mounting block 144a, the mounting
block 144a having a threaded hole 296 in engagement with the
; screw 288. As shown more clearly in Figure 5, a worm gear
298 engages the worm gear wheel 290 and has a shaft 302
10 located in respective bearings 304, 305 in a mounting block
307 secured to the mounting face 286. One end of the shaft
302 is connected to a coupling 309 joined to one end of a
flexible shaft 312 extending from a flexible conduit 314
which is secured by a clamp unit 316 to the mounting face
15 286. The other end of the flexible shaft 312 is secured to
the stepping motor/gearbox assembly 70 (not shown in Figures
4 and 5) in the same manner as that described in relation to .
the flexible shaft 160 of Figures la to 3.
In use of the manipulator 10a, rotation of the flexible
20 shaft 312 rotates the worm gear 298 and thereby the worm. gear
wheel 290 causing corresponding rotation of the mounting
block 144a, and rotation of the worm gear wheel 102 at the
wrist assembly 18a caused by rotation of the flexible shaft
121 results in pivotal movement of the mounting 284.
7 25 One advantage of the use of a worm gear and worm gear
. wheel to provide a pivotal movement of the manipulator, -
results from the self locking capability of such a gear
combination.
The structural components of the manipulators 10 and 10a
‘30 are conveniently fabricated from materials suited to the
application for which the manipulator is to be used. These
materials include stainless steel, aluminium, or plastics .
materials for light: duties and subsequent ease of disposal,
such plastics materials including glass fibre reinforced
35 plastics materials, or synthetic resin bonded fabric, for
example that sold under the Registered Trade Mark "TUFNOL".

It will be understood that other pivotal movements may ;
"be incorporated in the manipulators of Figures la to 5 in the
manner of the invention. The invention has been described in
relation to the use of electric stepping motors to give a
5 brushless drive that can easily be controlled using a small
computer, since the drive electronics are essentially .
digital, but as such the. manipulators of Figures la to 5
operate on open loop control, there being no feedback of .
position information. In more complex schemes, however,
10 position, velocity or acceleration transducers may be used to
monitor the position and the dynamics of the arms and their
pivotal joints of the manipulator of the invention, and the
derived information used to enhance the control of the
manipulator. The use of alternative motors or drive
15 mechanisms, which may be electric, hydraulic, or pneumatic,
may be more appropriate in some of these applications than
the aforesaid electric stepping motors. For example, direct
current torque motors to provide relatively high power to
weight ratios, disc motors to provide relatively high torque
20 to inertia ratios with low armature inductance, or induction
motors although an inverter would be required for adequate
control. For relatively heavy duty applications, an inverter
fed permanent magnet synchronous machine has advantages,
since it has a relatively high power to weight ratio and is
25 able to be accurately and repeatedly repositioned.
