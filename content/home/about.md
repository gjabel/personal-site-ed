# Biography

I worked in the nuclear industry for over 30 years, finishing my career as the Reactors Decommissioning Manager at Research Sites Restoration Ltd's [Harwell](https://www.harwellcampus.com/) Site in Oxfordshire. I am a Chartered Electrical Engineer, Fellow of the [Institution of Engineering and Technology](https://www.theiet.org/) and have a PhD in Engineering.

I started my career in heavy engineering and power stations, then worked in the field of cryogenic engineering, designing superconducting magnets and high speed linear machines for magnetically levitated trains. I moved to Harwell in 1979 and after three years of involvement with the [Sizewell B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sizewell_nuclear_power_stations) project, ran the UKAEA's Advanced Nuclear Robotics Project Group, developing nuclear-tolerant robots and stereoscopic television systems for use in the most extreme of working environments.

I then project-managed nuclear decommissioning projects, safely cleaned up highly contaminated nuclear facilities, demolished the buildings and restored the land to agreen field" conditions. I have also been a Consultant to the [International Atomic Energy Agency](https://www.iaea.org/) in Vienna and published over 50 technical papers and two patents. In my last full-time role I was responsible for the [last three reactors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Energy_Research_Establishment#Early_reactors) at Harwell - including the first large reactor built in Western Europe, in 1947, from which all UK gas-cooled reactor designs were derived.

I am currently director of LEBA Consulting Ltd and an external member of the Imperial College Reactor Centre Nuclear Safety Committee and Culham Site Safety Working Party. This website contains copies and further details on my past technical papers.
