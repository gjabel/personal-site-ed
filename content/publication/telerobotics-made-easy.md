abstract = "AEA Technology has developed, and now supplies, products that can reduce the cost and improve the reliability of decommissioning and radwaste operations. This paper describes some of the features of these products, which include NEATER, a telerobot based on acommercial industrial robot, and TV’ - an engineered 3-D TV System. The products are designed for the radiation and environmental conditions of a range of nuclear plant. The operator-robot interface has been improved by the provision of a telerobotic controller, and of a new multi-degree-of-freedom force reflecting input device, that can also be used to control many different types of slave manipulator. Human factors experiments and field trials have proved that the TV’ system gives useful performance benefits and is comfortable to view. NEATER and TV’ are affordable, robust systems which make telerobotics a realistic option for the nuclear industry."
