abstract = "The Wolfson magnetic levitation project is concerned with the construction of a 500 m long test track and vehicle, levitated electrodynamically by means of superconducting magnets. The general design features and present status of the project are described. The particular aspects which are discussed include the guideway design, the cryogenic system and superconducting coils, and both the linear synchronous and commutator motor propulsion systems having powered track windings.<br><br><br><br>"
