# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "A new telerobotic manipulator has been produced for use in nuclear and other industries where teleoperation or robotics is required, and environmental conditions exclude the use of standard manipulators. NEATER, the Nuclear Engineered Advanced Telerobot, is based on the adaption of a commercially available industrial robot to the particular needs of the nuclear industry. AEA Technology has worked directly with a robot manufacturer to ensure that NEATER benefits from the long term reliability that is common in_ industrial robots. “Radiation tolerant sub-systems have been included in NEATER’s design and three’ different versions are available to meet a wide range of application areas. A telerobotic controller is connected to the standard robot controller. The prototype NEATER has successfully ‘operated for over a year, with more than 1200 operating hours. Trials using telerobotically deployed tools for glovebox decommissioning have proved the concept, and robotic operations such as swabbing have been completed. The paper describes the background to the design, identifies the main features of NEATER and gives details of application areas.<br><br>"
