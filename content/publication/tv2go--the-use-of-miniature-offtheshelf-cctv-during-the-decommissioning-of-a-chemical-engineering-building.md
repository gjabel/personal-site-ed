# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "The 43 year old Chemical Engineering Building at AEA Technology's Harwell Laboratory is the subject of a decommissioning programme, with a scheduled green field end point in 1998. It has housed experimental and production plant covering the full spectrum of the nuclear fuel cycle. Clearance of the building is being accomplished using mainly hands-on methods. However, increasingly stringent legislation on topics such as manual handling, COSHH and workplace evaluation mean that every task has to be carefully planned and strictly controlled, with reference to a range of potential chemical and radiological hazards. Using techniques borrowed fromm remote systems technology, decommissioning operations now regularly employ Video and CCTV for inspection, surveillance, communication, record keeping, training and management control. This poster paper describes the use of miniature off-the-shelf colour CCTV systems that have been configured to meet a range of applications in the building. Because of their versatility, cheapness and the ease with which systems can be built quickly and made ready for use, they are known as TV2GO."
