abstract = "The paper describes the development and evaluation of 3-D Teievision Systems, 3-D TV had been developed with a view to proving whether it can be a useful remote handling tool which is easy to use and comfortable to view. The paper summarizes the principles of currently being built. The purpose of this operation, the initial development, the paper iS tO summarize tnis development and evaluation trials at UK facilities and it reviews the developments wnich have subsequently taken place. 3-D TV systems have been found to give improved performance in terms of speed and  accuracy of operations and to reduce the number of camera views required."
