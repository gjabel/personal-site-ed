# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "There is at present considerable interest in magnetic suspensions for high speed ground transport and in the complementary development of linear motors for propulsion. In particular, electrodynamic levitation, or maglev, in which d.c. excited magnets (superconducting) on the vehicle interact with a conducting (aluminium) track naturally lends itself to linear variants of the well-known synchronous or d.c. commutator machines.  Although linear synchronous machines (LSM) have received most attention hitherto (Thornton (1), Slemon (2)), in the following some reasons for considering the commutator machine (LCM) are outlined and a preliminary comparison of the machine types is made."
