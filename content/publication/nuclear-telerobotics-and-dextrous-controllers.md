abstract = "Two new fields of development at AEA Technology's Harwell Laboratory are described, covering telerobotics and hand controllers the nuclear industry. The first development <br><br>describes the production of a Nuclear Engineered Advanced Telerobot (NEATER) for applications in decommissioning and waste handling. It is a reengineered industrial robot based on Staubli-Unimation PUMA 762 clean room manipulator. The second development described concerns dextrous hand controllers which can be used to control the motion of a telerobotic robot manipulator end effector as it moves in space and contacts surfaces and ‘workpieces. Several input devices have been’ investigated for characteristics such as user-friendliness, compactness and cost effectiveness. Servo control of bilateral systems has been examined to optimize end point bilateral control. <br><br>"
