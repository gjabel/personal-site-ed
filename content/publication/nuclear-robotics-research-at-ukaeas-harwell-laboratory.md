abstract = "The Harwell Nuclear Robotics Programme uses demonstration hardware to validate generic design principles and to integration issues. This approach is explore systems integration issues before active plant design and trials begin. Three activities are described. A  prototype nuclear engineered telerobotic manipulator, based on an industrial robot, is being designed and constructed. This low cost device will be of use in decontamination, decommissioning and waste handling tasks, and several application studies and trials have been completed. The Robotics Demonstration Facility includes a computer controlled 5 tonne crane, a , gantry mounted robot and a floor standing robot. Both robots can function as telerobots using a specially input device controller, and have  overlapping workspaces. A remote hydraulic independent slave arm with force feedback  and connection to local and remote [>400m] workstations through a broadband communications link is the next stage of development of the successful Harwell hydraulic manipulator. <br><br>"
