abstract = "The decommissioning of Harwell’s two 26 MVWth) Materials Test Reactors (MTRs) started as soon as operations ceased in 1990. Initial defuelling, removal of the balance of plant and most of the surrounding buildings and facilities was completed by 1998. Several different dismantling plans have been proposed, but until now, the option of early removal of the reactor top shield plug in the decommissioning sequence has not been seriously considered. The drive to produce accelerated decommissioning plans for the Harwell Site (and MTRs) between 2004 - 07 forced the reactor decommissioning methodologies to rely heavily on remote handling techniques and increase the shielding for access to the reactors’ internal components. Early physical removal of the top shield plug was not a viable option. However, these programmes have been postponed and reactor internal dismantling is now unlikely to occur before 2027. Any further delay will make top plug removal a more plausible option, as activity levels decay.<br><br>In 1981, there were operational needs for rig access to the full core height in PLUTO. The solution was to totally replace the top shield plug with a new design that had more penetrations, including ones that avoided the horizontal through tubes. Two years of planning, design, procurement, testing and training followed. The replacement was carried out successfully on 5th November 1983, with the high active operation being controlled remotely from the Emergency Control Room, and lasting only 15 minutes. The reactor had been shut down on 28th October and reached full power again on 18th November. In essence, this was a pre-decommissioning, decommissioning operation.<br><br>The 1983 top shield plug replacement operation is described, and photographic records of the event are included. The original calculated and measured radiation levels are presented. Although radiological protection standards have improved since then and would influence a modern scheme design and operation in a different way, lessons can be learnt that will influence future decommissioning projects with similar tank-type reactors.<br><br>"
