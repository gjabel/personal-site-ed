abstract = "Early in 1997, one of the largest active buildings on UKAEA’s Harwell site was demolished. The seven storey Chemical Engineering Building housed experimental and production-scale equipment used to explore all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle, from fuel fabrication and zero energy reactors to reprocessing, high level liquid waste vitrification and decommissioning. In 1991, nearly 200 separate areas designated under the IRRs contained a variety of chemically and radiologically contaminated equipment and facilities. Since then all hazards have been removed from the building under a planned and carefully managed decommissioning and demolition programme. Seven examples from the programme are described.<br><br>"
