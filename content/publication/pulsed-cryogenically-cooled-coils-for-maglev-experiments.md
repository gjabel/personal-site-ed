# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "As a less costly alternative to the use of a superconducting coil in the experimental testing of the split-track maglev system for high speed transport, pulse-operated copper coils, cooled with liquid nitrogen, have been successfully used for the force measurements. Calculations have been carried out for constant current conditions to establish the conductor specific heat, resistance and voltage time relationships during the pulse, together with an experimental investigation of coil heat transfer in restricted open pool boiling. The result has been an increased sensitivity and the ability to examine a variety of configurations at a reduced cost."
