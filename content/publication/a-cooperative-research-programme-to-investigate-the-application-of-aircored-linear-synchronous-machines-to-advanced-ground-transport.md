abstract = "Railways throughout the world are beginning to rely more heavily on advances in technology to increase their effectiveness as a transport mode compared to the airplane and motorcar. In doing so the emphasis is usually placed on achieving higher average speeds to generate a commercial gain of reduced trip time, with the conflicting constraint of increase of cost usually providing the limiting factor.<br><br>Some areas where the impact of new technologies can be immediately felt are:<br><br>Aerodynamic drag reduction<br><br>Required energy reduction<br><br>Tare weight per seat reduction<br><br>More efficient use of track<br><br>Better forms of traction and power conversion<br><br>Higher average speeds through improved suspensions<br><br>Increases in load factor<br><br>Use of automation to reduce required manpower<br><br>Although some of these effects can be achieved by slight extensions to common practice, others represent distinct changes in philosophy for railway adminstrations. In particular, the trend has developed to produce fixed formation, articulated-rake trains with integral power for operation in the high speed 200-300 km/h (125-186 mph) range. Likewise, there is a growing interest in the development of novel techniques of propulsion, guidance and suspension for the very high speeds of 300-500 km/h (186-310 mph).<br><br>In all the proposed configurations, the method of trac tion chosen will heavily influence the other subsystems' design. For example, to meet the tractive power requirement at 500 km/h, either a wheel trainset with the best of conventional traction motors, or an attractive, magnetically-levitated vehicle with linear induction motor drive, would face severe problems in finding adequate remaining space for payloads.<br><br>The following proposal outlines the areas of existing work on AGT traction systems and suggests a possible line of research on one of the more promising of the linear drive systems, i.e. the air-cored, linear synchronous machine using superconducting magnets.<br><br>"
