# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "This paper describes a development of 3-D television systems at Harwell and a comparison of a 3-D system with conventional TV. 3-D TV has been proven to be a useful remote handling tool which gives operators improved perception of the remote scene and so enables them to perform tasks more accurately and quickly.  The paper describes trials at Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories with a Harwell 3-D TV system. This trial involved the performance of a navigation task via a remote manipulator which showed a significant benefit for three-dimensional television. This adds to the existing knowledge of TV systems performance for remote tasks which enables cost-benefit assessments to be made for new applications. A recently developed radiation tolerant 3-D camera is also described."
