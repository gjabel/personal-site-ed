# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "This paper describes the development of a new 6-axis general purpose Hand Controller called the Cartesian mini Master Arm (CmMA). It provides end-point bilateral control in remote manipulative operations. Though the device is primarily intended for use with the NEATER Robot, thus making it a true Telerobot, it can also be used with many other remote handling systems including Hydraulic Servo Manipulators and other industrial robots. Emphasis is placed on the optimisation of the end point  bilateral control since the majority of the critical tasks that have to be performed remotely involve the control of manipulator end effector interaction with the object and/or environment. The paper also deals with the rationale used to determine the master arm kinematics, dynamics and control. The principles of operation and control have been tested in simulation and through construction of a mechanism breadboard. A prototype unit will be operational by the end of 1990.<br><br><br><br>"
