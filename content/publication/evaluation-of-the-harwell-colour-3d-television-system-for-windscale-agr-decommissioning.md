abstract = "Trials of the Harwell colour stereoscopic (or three dimensional) television system are described. A task was based on a real operation planned as part of decommissioning Windscale’s Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor (WAGR); two heavy steel plates were moved between stands and a plate rack using an overhead gantry crane. The task required translation, rotation and accurate positioning of the plates.<br><br>Operators were timed whilst using 2D or 3D television viewing systems. For analysis, the task was divided into components. The one which required accurate alignment of a plate benefited most<br><br>from using 3D and was performed 17% faster. The difference was statistically significant. The data from this component are consistent with the supposition that 3D is particularly useful in unfamiliar<br><br>situations or the initial learning of a task.<br><br>Videotapes of two of the operators recorded during the trials showed that a supplementary 2D view was used differently when the main view was 3D rather than 2D; with 3D, the operators looked at<br><br>the supplementary view for only a small percentage of the time. A third operator showed a less marked difference, but was thought not to be typical of those who participated in the experiment.<br><br>A questionnaire was completed by 8 operators. Picture quality of both 2D and 3D was highly rated. All except one had preferred using the 3D and would have been happy to do so for extended<br><br>periods. Most thought that they had performed the task better with 3D and that a supplementary view was less of a necessity with a 3D main view.<br><br>Two main improvements were suggested by the operators; that the camera should be fitted with either zoom lenses or a switchable angle of view, and that clip-on polarising glasses should<br><br>be made available for spectacle wearers.<br><br>Some of the subjects” comments suggest, in accord with earlier findings, that the positioning of a single 3D view is far less critical than the optimal siting of a pair of 2-D views.<br><br><br><br>"
