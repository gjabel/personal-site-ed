# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Two years ago, the Harwell Nuclear Robotics Programme was conceived by consolidating some of the most appropriate technical areas from the existing UKAEA's Active Handling Programme. After a thorough review of robotics technology, several research topics were identified which needed special attention. Communications, servo characterization, robot enhancements, radiation tolerance and systems integration were selected as areas where non-nuclear research was not adequate for successful implementation of robotics to a wide range of nuclear facilities. This paper focusses on these five areas, and describes how industrial standard-based solutions will be examined and applied to active handling equipment."
