abstract = "A development project has been initiated at Harwell Laboratory to investigate the feasibility and ramifications of a general purpose hand controller for bilateral control of standard 6-axis manipulators and robots. By general purpose, it is meant that the input command device shall be capable of co-ordinating and controlling the remote manipulator's joints as the operator desires. Forces and torques may also be reflected on the three positional and three orientational axes of the hand controller giving the operator a kinesthetic sense of the task he is manipulating remotely. Since the kinematics and dynamics are dissimilar between the hand controller and the manipulator, the implementation of the unilateral and bilateral control system requires a computer to deal with these disparities. This paper reviews the state of the art of general purpose hand controllers and examines the use of parallel link and hybrid serial-parallel link structures for use in the development of an efficient bilateral hand controller, as part of the on-going Nuclear Robotics Programme at Harwell.<br><br>"
