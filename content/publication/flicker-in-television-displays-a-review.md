abstract = "Minimising flicker is not always a primery consideration when specifying television displays, or the conditions under which they will be viewed. Consequently excessive flicker may be experienced. A consideration of the factors which affect the percepticn of flicker suggests the following measures can usefully be appiied when flicker is found to be a problem:<br><br>-Reduce the contrast of the display.<br><br>-Reduce the overall briahtness of the display.<br><br>-Ensure that ambient lighting is not too bright.<br><br>-Ensure that the display does not subtend too large a visual angle by allowing a reasonable viewing distance; a distance of four to six times the picture height is recommended. Do not use a monitor larger than necessary.<br><br>-Ensure that the black-level of the display is correctly set so that black areas of the picture are reproduced as black rather than mid-grey.<br><br>-Where a number of monitors are used simultaneously their scans should, ideally, be synchronised.<br><br>-If at all possible, displays positioned such that they are in peripheral vision for much of the time should be avoided or switched off when not in use.<br><br>-Flicker is more likely to be a problem for younger persons, <br><br>Display brightness and contrast, ambient lighting and viewinagdistance are constrained by practical considerations. A display must be bright enough and have enough contrast to be intelligible; ambient lighting must be bright enough to allow concurrent tasks, such as paperwork or working the controls of a machine. Viewing distance should not be increased beyond that for which an observer cannot resolve the detail in the display.<br><br>The flicker generated can be minimised by the design of the display:-<br><br>-A long persistence phosphor will reduce flicker, but will also cause blurring of moving pictures. For many applications this may be unacceptable.<br><br>-Interlace is best avoided for field rates around 50Hz, particularly where short viewing distances are unavoidable.<br><br>-It is possible to build displays to operate at fieid rates greeter than 50Hz. These are a good solution for computer displays, but present a problem for television systens; the entire system must operate at the higher field rate and will thus be incompatible with existing equipment. Ancillaries working at increased field rates are likely to be costly.<br><br>-In the near future it will be possible to display viedeo signals from conventional television equipment on high scan rate monitors by employing digital signal processing.  However, to be really effective scan, conversions must be motion adaptive and at the monent this is not a trivial problem.<br><br>There is some evidence to suggest that the humen visual system responds to intermittent illumination at frequencies above flicker fusion. However an experiment by the authors found no major differences in an observers performance of a visual search task at three different field rates; 50, 80 and 100Hz.<br><br>No conclusive evidence has demonstrated that flicker causes eyestrain or has any long term, adverse effects on health, although most people would agree flickering displays are unpleasant to work with."
