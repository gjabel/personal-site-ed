abstract = "Flicker in a CRT display can upset the control of saccadic eye movement, even at frequencies above flicker fusion. The effect decreases with increasing field rate, therefore operator performance of a demanding visual task may be facilitated by using a display with a high scan rate. The experiment described here compared the speed and accuracy with which a visual search task was performed when the display field rate was 50, 80 and 100Hz."
