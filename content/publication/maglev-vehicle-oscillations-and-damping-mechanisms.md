# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "For high speed ground transport, magnetic levitation, using repulsion between moving high field (superconducting) magnets and an electrically conducting guideway may be considered. The same magnets may be the field windings of a linear synchronous motor for propulsion. The nature of the magnetic and other forces acting on the vehicle are discussed. For acceptable ride characteristics additional damping is needed, probably provided by an active control system. The Wolfson sponsored project to build a demonstration maglev vehicle at the University of Warwick is described."
