abstract = "When operating linear synchronous machines, three main design options emerge. For a particular mechanical loading the machine can be run at either maximum efficiency, unity or maximum power factor, or minimum terminal rating. Each of the options are analysed, using the machine performance equations, and their effects on machine terminal requirements are compared, using the CIGGT motor as an example."
