abstract = "Decommissioning Harwell’s two 26MW(th) Materials Test Reactors (MTRs) was started as soon as operations ceased and both were shut down on 31st March 1990. Stages 1 and 2: phase 1, decommissioning included defuelling, removal of all fissile and rigs’ sample materials, draining of the heavy water and its transfer to Winfrith, removal of the balance of plant and demolition of most of the surrounding buildings and facilities. That programme of work was completed by 1998. At this point, the reactors were expected to stay in continuous Care and Surveillance until approximately 2037 — 2040, by which time radioactive decay would have reached a point that further delay would not show significant benefits in waste management cost saving nor in ease of decommissioning. By then a National ILW Repository was expected to be available.Several different dismantling plans for Stage 3 (decommissioning to green field) were proposed in the period between 1990 — 2002; some examined options for early decommissioning but the best option was always to defer. However, in 2003 — 2004, an accelerated programme was proposed for decommissioning UKAEA facilities. For Harwell, the MTRs would be decommissioned by 2025 and the whole Harwell Site would be delicensed. Subsequent years’ programmes were improved such that both of the MTRs could be decommissioned by December 2016, provided the Front End<br><br>Decommissioning Engineering and Regulatory engagement could be started in 2007. The challenge for accelerated decommissioning was to produce safe and cost-effective strategies using predominantly commercial off the shelf (COTS) equipment. However, the decommissioning techniques proposed in the pre-2004 plans were not suited to such a rapid programme and the original techniques were unduly complicated and expensive. Year-on-year improvements to the plans have produced more efficient and cheaper methodologies that would make early decommissioning possible, provided the funding and technical skills resource were available. By 2008, national funding priorities for the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority have meant that the UKAEA accelerated programmes have been re-assessed; the Harwell MTRs will remain in Care and Surveillance until at least 2021, assuming funding levels are not further reduced. Nevertheless, the improved approach to decommissioning will continue to be the baseline. Previous DIDO Operators’ Meetings, in particular the 1997 Julich Meeting, have had presentations from Harwell about the status of decommissioning work. This paper will give a description of the organisational changes that have happened, a brief pictorial overview of the DIDO and PLUTO early decommissioning milestone events since shutdown, provide a few more details of the DIDO HAHC decommissioning and describe the philosophy behind accelerated decommissioning plans.<br><br>"
