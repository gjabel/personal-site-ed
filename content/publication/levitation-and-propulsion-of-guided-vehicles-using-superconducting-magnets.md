# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Levitation and guidance of high speed vehicles by means of magnetic forces between superconducting magnets on the vehicle and eddy currents set up in an aluminium track is described. Linear motor propulsion is discussed and induction machines are shown to be incompatible with the levitation. In contrast synchronous or commutator machines, using the existing mgnets as field excitation, and with a powered track winding show great promise. In particular the commutator machine, which has good starting characteristics, will be studied further. The test track and research vehicle being built at the University of Warwick is described briefly."
