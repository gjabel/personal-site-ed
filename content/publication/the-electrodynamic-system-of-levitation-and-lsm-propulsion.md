abstract = "There are essentially two basic systems for the magnetic levitation and guidance of high speed tracked vehicies which are at present receiving serious investigation world-wide, namely a i) the electromagnetic system (EMS), ii) the electrodynamic system (EDS). The EMS is based essentially on the attractive forces between conventional copper magnets with iron yokes on the vehicle and iron rails along the track. Because this is basically an unstable system, active control of the magnet currents is essential to maintain the clearance between the magnets and the rail, a distance of approximately 10 - 15 mm. The EDS, on the other hand,relies for levitation and guidance on the repulsive forces which are generated between moving iron-free, superconducting magnets on the vehicle and conducting (aluminium) sheets (or coils) at ambient temperature on the track. In its application to high speed transport, some of the essential features of the EDS can be enumerated as follows:<br><br>1) The vehicle is magnetically levitated and laterally guided in a statically stable manner solely by magnetic forces generated in the aluminium guideway by the vehicle magnets.<br><br>2) The clearance between the vehicle and the guideway can be in the range of 100- 400mm.<br><br>3) The levitation and guidance forces are analogous to those produced by a resilient undamped spring with a resonant frequency of the order of 1-2 Hz.<br><br>4) The circulating currents induced in the aluminium guideway give rise to magnetic drag forces which have to be overcome by the propulsion system.<br><br>5) The superconducting magnets on the vehicle operate at liquid helium temperature (4.2K) in the persistent (short-circuited) mode and hence require no power on-board. e<br><br>6) At standstill and lew speeds up to approximately 40 - 50 km/h, wheels are necessary to support the vehicle.<br><br>7) From the point of view of the efficiency of a linear motor operating with air gaps of the order of 100mm, a linear synchronous motor would be used, the powered armature windings being installed along the track.<br><br>8) Power conditioning units spaced at intervals (5 - 15 km) would provide the three-phase current to the track windings which interacts with the vehicle superconducting magnets.<br><br>9) Various schemes for combining linear motor propulsion and guidance or, in the case of the Warwick design, combined propulsion, lift and guidance, are being examined.<br><br>"
