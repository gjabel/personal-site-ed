# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Design criteria are established for finite radius rectangular superconducting coils as designed for magnetically levitated trains. Two approaches are followed. A simple stress analysis of a finite radius rectangular coil is presented which compares the stress level in the coil with an equivalent circular coil, for which anistropy can be included. The limiting radius for a particular stress level can hence be chosen. Using the impedance modelling technique establishes the degradation of lift to drag ratio and dependence of lateral stiffness on the variation of corner radius for the Warwick Maglev Geometry.<br><br>"
