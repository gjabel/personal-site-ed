abstract = "The sample revenue vehicle designs of the two German Maglev groups have been analysed and the complex power requirement at trackside substations has been calculated. The two systems are the Electromagnetic system (EMS) with either linear induction motor (LIM) or long stator motor propulsion, and the Electrodynamic System (EDS) with linear synchronous motor (LSM) propulsion. The operational conditions considered were 400 and 500 km/h velocities either at a steady-state cruise or with a grade or headwind additional loading. It is found that the LSM of the EDS is the most suitable form of propulsion for these operating conditions, the long stator motor for the EMS having reasonable characteristics at 400 km/h, but becoming degraded at 500 km/h, and the LIMs studied being unsuited to 500 km/h, and not very good even at 400 km/h. These results highlight the need in a system comparison to not merely compare specific power or lift to drag ratio, which denote the active power supplied to a vehicle, but to compare complex power at wayside substations to indicate the overall efficiencies and power factors of the competing system.<br><br>"
