AEA Technology's 3D TV equipment shows performance benefits over conventional
television — it is quicker and easier to use, requiring less precision and less camera
deployment manipulators. Operators have taken to the new system very quickly.

A The latest, third generation 3D TV camera can be used in many different nuclear applications. Requirements were matched at
different nuclear facilities in the UK and the most stringent values adopted. This approach placed extreme constraints on the
camera design, but the result is a versatile and robust camera which will also be suitable for many applications beyond those
foreseen at present.
