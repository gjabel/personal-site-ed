Abstract

Design criteria are established for finite radius rectangular
superconducting coils as designed for magnetically levitated trains.
Two approaches are followed. A simple stress analysis of a finite
radius rectangular coil is presented which compares the stress level
in the coil with an equivalent circular coil, for which anistropy can
be included. The limiting radius for a particular stress level can
hence be chosen.

Using the impedance modelling technique establishes the degradation
of lift to drag ratio and dependence of lateral stiffness on the varia—
tion of corner radius for the Warwick Maglev Geometry.

4. Introduction

The use of superconducting magnets for both the levitation and
linear motor propulsion of high speed trains is being considered by
different groups in several cottitries‘?) , The majority of designs are
based on rectangular or square coils, which will be vound as racetrack
coils — ise. with semicircular end windings. This arrangement relieves
the manufacturing and operational difficulties associated with sharp

, corners, of winding migration and stress concentration. However, for
the coordinated maglev system combining levitation, guidance and pro-
pulsion being studied at the University of Warwick, the magnetic forces
ere generated by all four sides of a magnet in a longitudinal array of
magnets on the vehicle. Any deviation from a rectangular magnet results
in a degradation of the required magnetic forces.

t

; Proposed maglev systems tend to choose long thin levitation

magnets to produce enhanced lift to drag ratios. For example the
Canadian Reference Design (2? comprises eight 1.0 m x 0.3 m levitation
magnets, for a 30 tonne vehicle. The propulsion magnets' size is
determined by thrust requirements, passenger density and hardware costs,
but generally a wavelength in the range 1—3 meters seems Keesonsbie'>),
The vehicle width naturally constrains the Space left for a propulsion .
magnet array, after levitation magnets are sized. For a full racetrack
end—wound propulsion coil, linear motor active length is reduced by about
half a wavelength, compared to a rectangular coil. If a transverse-flux
or dual-motor configuration\4) is adopted, then four sets of machine
magnet endwindings have to be accommodated in the vehicle width.

In this paper, a simplified method for stressing finite radius
rectangular coils, based on comparison with a circular solenoid equivalent
is presented, and model measurements illustrate the effects of transition
from a Square to a circular geometry on lift to drag ratio and guidance
stiffness for the Warwick flat track maglev system. °
2e Stress Analysis
2e1 Previous Analysis

Many authors have established methods of analysis of varying complexity
to determine the forces on coil systems. Essentially the forces can be
put into three catamiries 9),

1) Mechanical, due to coil winding, pre-stressing and support.

2) Thermomechanical forces due to uneven material contraction

during cool-down.

3) Magnetomechanical forces when the coil is energized.

The stresses arising from category (3) forces are those discussed in
this papere

In the case of a circular Superconducting solenoid, the stress levels
can be easily computed using a thick/thin cylinder SiiiPoximation©), A
homogeneous thick cylinder theory produces a more accurate solution’,

Since the coils are anisotropic structures, account must be taken of the
orthotropy, in evaluating the stress tensor. Muthall analyzes a homo~
geneous anistropic solenoia(8) and several more recent papers consider
transversely isotropic solenoids (9) and stresses in anistropic cots’ 10911)
under the three force categories previously mentioned. ,

2.2 Simplified Analysis

For a coil structure with a finite corner radius it can be assumed
that the most critical stress levels will be reached at the cornerse
In place of the exact solution that was possible with circular coils,
several approximate solutions can be formulated and referenced to a
circular coil stress level.

In particular the analysis is based on a magnetic pressure comparison
of rectangular and square tubes with a circular thick walled tube, since
the free-body diagram of sections of the two cases are identical. When
a circular coil is analysed, an exact solution approaches that derived
by a magnetic pressure approximation if the coil build is small compared
to its dianeter‘12), his condition is usually met by maglev coils,
where the strength is of the order of 500 kAT.for the motor magnets,
and size is of the order of 0.5-3 m x i~3 m.

2.2.1 — Circular Coil

magnetic pressure P,, produces hoop stress [%, radial stress 0), and

Naturally the coil flux density is modified for the same ampere
turns as the corner radius is changed, The ‘central field normalized
by the factor Mo I is plotted in Figure 1.for the transition from a

Square coil to a circular coil. The values range from a for a circular
coil to V2 for a square coil. Although the value of flux density to
be used in equation (4) should be that of the inner face of the coil,
the central field value from Figure 1 is a reasonable guide to the
exact value.

Using equations (13) and (9), the radius for a particular wound
section (implying c and d) can be found where the stress level equals
that of an equivalent circular coil of the same section. The circular
equivalent coil can then be analysed using exact solutions and
including anistropy.

3 Impedance Modelling
301 Technique

The magnetic forces generated by a _ yehicle can be analysed
using the impedance modelling technique ‘'4 - Previous work’ 19) has
suggested that at high speeds the lift and drag forces of a square
coil are identical to those obtained from a circular coil. This
applied to an infinite sheet conductor and to assess the influence of
a split track a series of coils were wound with different corner
radii (Figure 4).

The two parameters of interest are the lift to drag (L/D) ratio,
which is a measure of the power requirement, and the guidance stiffness
Yy"s which defines the stability. The guidance stiffness a is given
by

-5-

Y,' s xl ey (16)
where 2a is the coil width, Y is the lateral restoring force, y is the
lateral displacement, mg is the vehicle weight (i.e. the lift force at
the equilibriun position).

362 Resnits
Using a single coil over a split track, the L/D ratio and Y,' have
been measured for a range of track conductor Spacings. The results are
Shown in Figures 5 and 6. The data has been scaled to give the forces
On a 166 m long coil, moving at 135 m/s, with a clearance of 0.24 m
over an aluminium track 40 ma thick. Each conductor is assumed to be
0.75 m wide. The results have been normalised to the Square coil value
obtained when the coil overlaps each Conductor by 40 mm full scale ;
(2 (a ~ at) = 0.33). In this position two coils in tandem and of
opposite polarity generate a L/D ratio of 25, and have @ guidance
stiffness of is of 6.4, which is sufficient to give a lateral
oscillation frequency of 4 He 16) |
Tt is apparent that the optimum coll~track geometry occurs at
different track Spacings for each shape. he L/D ratio as a function
of corner radius is plotted in Figure 1 for two values of guidance
stiffness, corresponding to lateral oscillation frequencies of 1 Hz and
1e4 Hz. In both cases the circular coil shows 4 reduction in lift to
drag ratio of 27% when compared with the square coil,
3e3 Effect on Power Requirement
If a magnet array of circular coils is used instead of Square coils,
the magnet drag power is increased by 37%. However the dominating drag
force for Maglev vehicles arises from aerodynamic effects. For example
a vehicle moving at 135 m/s has to overcome .an aerodynamic drag force
of pproximately 3 tonnes (17), (c, = 0.3, om” frontal area). For a
30 tonne vehicle the magnetic drag force is 4,2 tonnes if the suspension
magnets are square coils (L/D = 25). the total power requirement in
changing from Square to circular coils is therefore increased by only 10%.
Conversely, if the track thickness is increased by 37% then the
Circular coil requires the same power input as the Square coil. In
comparison with other track designs (19), the Warwick design would still
be the most economical in terms of guideway aluminium costs.

4- Conclusions
The two main areas of interest in determining the choice of magnet
endwinding shape for cryogenic maglev are
1) Magnitude of self forces in coils
2) Effects on electrodynamic system performance
A simple method has been presented to enable first estimates to
be made on stress levels in rectangular coils with corner radii.
Comparison with circular coils under the same magnetic pressure estab-
Lishes the allowable size of corner radius.
The effects on the lift to drag ratio and guidance stiffness as
corner radius changes is qualified for the proposed Warwick geometry.
A reduction in performance must be accepted with increasing corner
radius.
The paper presents only the first steps in an analysis of a systeme
. Further work is necessary in detail for each component of the system
before full specification can be achieved.
