Linear Synchronous Machine Design for Minimum Terminal Rating

Summary

When operating linear synchronous machines, three main design
options emerge. For a particular mechanical loading the machine
can be run at either maximum efficiency, unity or maximum power
factor, or minimum terminal rating. Each of the options are analysed,
using the machine performance equations, and their effects on machine
terminal requirements are compared, using the CIGGT motor as an
example.
1. Introduction

Linear Synchronous Machine (LSM) analysis shows that machine
efficiency is maximised when the track and vehicle current sheet
magneto motive forces are displaced by nm radians. At this opera-

i: tional positeiton the machine behaves (aien viewed from the terminals)
as an inductive load. Because of the phase reactance, the machine
draws lagging reactive current from the distribution system, and the
terminal rating is that deduced from the real power obtained from
the machine and its overall efficiency and power factor.

Conventional control of synchronous machines usually involves
local open loop operation with the current angle (or torque angle)

i
less that ™ radians. Increased loading on the machine whieh forces
the current angle to exceed this value will result in slippage and
loss of synchronism. The method of céntrol is to vary the field
current on the rotor by means of an automatic voltage regulator
(AVR) and if this is sufficiently controlled in closed loop the
machine may be made to operate beyond its previous torque limit.
If current forcing of the machine armature is used with a rotor
1.

position feedback loop, then four quadrant operation of the machine

is possible. The latter method of control for ISM's is more

promising, since the possibility of operating the on-board super-
conducting magnets in other than the persistant current mode is remote at
present, because of the excessive a.c. loss,and would incur payload

and auxiliary power penalties. -

Provided the machine phase reactance is small, the machine may
be operated to correct or increase its own powerfactor, by balancing
the induced voltage component against the reactive drop, so that from
the terminals the load appears to be largely resistive, depending
on the magnitude of back emf available. Usually this will give a
lower terminal power requirement over the maximised efficiency opera-
tion, and will also reduce the terminal phase voltage. Accompanying
these improvements is a necessary increase in phase current require-
ment.

‘A third design option is to operate the machine so that the
total complex power requirement (volt-amperes ) is minimised, which
usually will occur with a current angle between the first two
options. Since the distribution network and associated switchgear,
transformers and convertors will always be rated in terms of complex
power, this is perhaps the most reasonable of the three approaches.

Each of the three alternative operating conditions will be
analysed and then the CIGGT machine will be examined and the effect
on terminal rating demonstrated.

3e2 Power factor effects
Exact compensation of the LSM power factor will occur if the
resolved back emf exactly matches the leakage inductance voltage
drop in the armature phase winding, and unity power factor at the
terminals will ensue. If the phase reactance is too large then
the back emf phasor can only be manipulated to maximise the machine
power factor.

voltages V. and V5 that are in phase and quadrature respectively
with the phase current.

Ay Effect of choice of current angle on a particular design
The numerical values used to evaluate the different operating
conditions are based on the CIGGT design. This LSM develops 40 kN
thrust at its cruise speed of 480 km/h, which corresponds to a
developed mechanical output power of 5.34 MW. The phase inductance
and resistance are 2.42 mH/km and 0.56 9 /km respectively, which
for a 5km block length give values of terminal reactance and
8.

resistance of 8.89 2 and 2.8 2 - The back emf is 4 kV.
The armature is meander wound into three phases.

4.2 Power factor
Since in (15) OP RX = 1.982 > 1, there is no balance point
a
for unity power factor operation, and equation (19) must be used to
find maximum power factor value of a °
Substituting into (19)
af = t®  e cot 7 { 3.175 [ G.wrree)? - «| °
which solves to give ao = 121° as the position of maximum power
factor. Using (7) - (10) cos 9 = 0.8860 at its maximum.
4.3 Minimum terminal rating
A H.P. 9100A calculator program has been written to evaluate
o for minimum terminal rating, for inputs Pas ERY m, R and X.
The print out is of the form (for the CIGGT machine)
PR = 534 06
ER = 4 O00.
m = 3. Input data
R = 2.8
X = 8.89
Ge

r/2 = 1.087123
p/3 = 1.271759
a/3 = ~ «617370 Output data
b/2 = 1.236390
p@ = 1.137256
° = 108.050268 = ¢
So the current angle for minimum terminal rating is 108°,
5.0 Per-unit values
By definition,
a per-unit (pu) value = actual value (in any unit)
base value (in the same unit)
It is common synchronous machine practice to refer parameters
to the expected operating condition base. If the CIGGT machine
performance is plotted out (Figure 1), the values of o for the
various conditions calculated in the previous sections are confirmed,
| and the variation of terminal phase power, current and voltage can
be normalized with respect to the base a@ values. The normalization
of values is not only for graphical simplicity; similar machine types
or design variations are much more easily compared, especially with
respect to sensitivity to parameter variations. 3
6.0 Comparison of design options
The minimum complex power base value is 8.27 MVA, with terminal
voltage of 5.89 kV and phase current of 468 amps. The three design
options and relevant performance are shown in Table I.

It is not immediately apparent, for this particular design, whether
the choice to operate at minimum terminal rating offers any real
advantage over @ = n /2° ~ there is only a 6% reduction in
VA rating. This is because of the broadness of the variation of
Sp about its minimum point, in this case. Table II shows the change
in active and complex powers for per unit base of a) a = 90° and
b) a = 108°,
Sas complex Fr, active Op reactive

So 1 1.06 1 0.975 1 1229
108 0.943 1 1.03 1 0.777 | 1
121 0.978 1.04 41.09 1.06 0.754 | 0.971
Table II Per unit terminal powers for bases ofa = 90° and 408°
In going from 0 = 90° to a = 108°, a reduction of 22% in
| ‘terminal reactive power can be achieved, with only a 3% increase in
active power; the total power also drops by 6%. From this base the
effect of going to the maximum power factor @ = 121° point only
reduces reactive power by 3% and requires a 6% and 4% increase in
active and total power respectively. The associated increase in the
armature track loss would amount to 23% because the machine efficiency ~
is beginning to drop off more rapidly at @ > 110°, (Figure 1).
Operation at minimum Sp will generally mean a terminal voltage
that has reduced by more than the phase current has increased. The
implication is that the phase current affects the track heating and
conductor temperature rise and so determines the type of insulation
and its ageing, and that terminal voltage affects the insulation
and inverter semiconductor required blocking voltage. The CIGGT
machine terminal voltage reduces by 10% and phase current increases
by only 5%, in going from a = 90° to a@ = 108°.
11.

Generally, it is more important in designing a linear
superconducting machine to be fully aware of the variations
that will be present in the system performance, rather than to
strictly specify precise operating regimes, since these will be
dictated by the installed system economics. It is sufficient
to note that the LSM is not as restricted in terms of available
tractive power as for example a linear induction machine.
Because the armature winding is in the guideway, specific
loading of the machine can be changed by simply changing
armature conductor dimensions to suit particular guideway grades,
acceleration requirements etc., without penalizing vehicle pay
load or cruise capability.
