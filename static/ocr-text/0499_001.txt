ABSTRACT
The paper describes the development and evaluation of 3-D Television Systems.
3-D TV had been developed with a view to proving whether it can be a useful
remote handling tool which is easy to use and comfortable to view. The paper
Summarizes the principles of operation, the initial development, the evaluation
trials at UK facilities and it reviews the developments which have been found to
give improved performance in terms of speed and accuracy of operations and to
reduce the number of camera views required.
1. INTRODUCTION
The Engineering Sciences Division of Harwell Laboratory carries out research and
development of remote television systems for remote handling in nuclear
environments. The work includes equipment development and human factors
experimentation; its ultimate aim is to facilitate the widespread introduction of
television (TV) viewing equipment into nuclear plant.
The work includes the development of stereoscopic or three-dimensional (3-D) TV.
This programme of work is nearing completion, it has been split up into the
following stages:
a - Determine criteria for design of 3-D TV to be comfortable to view and useful
for remote operations :

b - Build engineering prototype systems
c - Evaluation of prorotypes in various cold mock-up facilities
d - Build 2nd generation system, and evaluate
e - Build 3rd generation, radiation-tolerant black-and-white system
f - deploy camera in radioactive environments
The programme is complete up to stage (e); the third generation, radiation-
tolerant camera is built, and trials have begun. The purpose of this paper is to
summarize this development and evaluation programme. The work has made available
3-D TV systems which give useful improvements in depth perception for a wide
range of viewing requirements and environmental conditions. The systems have
proved comfortable to view, easy to use, and rohust in operation.

2. 3-D TV
The purpose of the 3-D systems developed at Harwell is to give operators improved
depth information about a remote scene. The 3-D systems do this by providing the
viewer with binocular information which allows him to perceive a solid image from
two flat pictures. The two pictures come from two cameras which are offset a
smal] distance horizontally and whose focussing targets are in the same plane.
(The focussing target is equivalent to the film in a camera). The two pictures
are identical except for small horizontal differences in image position. These
disparities vary with the distance of the objects from the camera, so there are a
range of disparities for different objects in a normal scene; they allow the
viewer to see the picture in 3-D.
Figure 1 shows a viewer looking at a 3-D screen which allows him to see only the
right image with his right eye and the left image with the left eye. Because
there is a horizontal disparity between the left and right images of the same
object, the viewer is tricked into perceiving the object behind the screen. A
3-D picture is built up of a large number of such points, with different
horizontal disparities and therefore different distances behind or in front of
the screen.
Some object points may give no horizontal disparity and so their images appear in
the screen plane. They have no disparity difference because the object is in the
plane in front of the 3-D camera in which the two camera axes cross. The control
of the camera axes can thus be used to control the position of the 3-D image
relative to the screen. The objects of interest are normally placed close to the
screen plane, ie the cameras are converged on the objects of interest. This is
important because we have found that viewers can only cope with a limited range
of horizontal disparities. The limitation is because the viewer's eyes stay
focussed on the screen but they change convergence around the scene to converge
at distances appropriate to the image point placement. In other words, we find
that the viewer can accept small discrepancies between accommodation and
convergence, but not large ones. We have therefore designed systems to enable
the operator to keep the image acceptably ciose to the screen, in a truncated
pyramid, as shown in Figure 2.

3. 3-D TV PICTURES: CALCULATIONS OF SIZE AND SHAPE
The shape and size of a stereo image can be calculated geometrically, some of the
more basic formulae are derived below. The pioneering analysis of 3-D images was
carried out in the 1950'sl!»2 for the motion pictures. The same principles
are used in the equations below, though these are expressed in ways more
applicable to TV systems. 3-D image shape and size can be defined by the
magnifications from object points to image points There are three magnification
factors to consider, width magnification (M,), depth magnification (My) and
height magnification (M,). Height and width magnifications will normally be
the same, apart from very small discrepancies when the image is viewed
obliquely;My, will be used here to cover both. Depth magnification is subject
to different constraints and is, in general, different to My. Both Mg and
My may vary with distance from the camera; in other words, reproduction may not
be linear throughout a scene.
Figure 3 shows a representation of a stereo camera and object scene. 0
represents an object point distance p in front of the 3-D camera, the cameras are
converged by axial offset (distance h) of each lens. Expressions for 1 and r
(see Figure 3) may be found by similar triangles, and the camera parallax z, by

Figure 3, Stereo Camera and Scene Figure 4, Viewing Arrangement

This parallax is transferred to the viewing screen but it is increased by the
magnification factor, M
M = screen width
target width
Screen Parallax (Z) = Mz (2)
The viewing arrangement is shown in Figure 4. In the case of Figure 4, Z is
negative because the right image point appears to the left of the left image
point. The viewer to image point distance (P) is:
P=VE (3)
EF-T7
P= VEp (4)
Mft - p(2Mh - E£)
It can be seen that the equations apply equally well if Z is positive, but that
in this case the image point appears behind the screen.
The depth magnification can now be determined by differentiating equation 4 with
respect to p:
Mg = dP = VEMft
dp  (Mft - p(oMh - £))2 (5)
Similarly expressions may be derived for lateral position mapping (Q as a
function of q, see Figures 3 and 4)
Q= E(Sp + Maf) (6)
Mft - p(2Mh - E)
and differentiating with respect to q gives width magnification:
My = dQ = MfE (7)
dp Mft - p(2Mh - £)
The image shape ratio gives the shape of the image at a given point:
. Shape ratio (u) = Mg = Vt (8)
My Mft - p(2Mh - E)
Finally we need to know the relationship between the lens offset (h) and the
convergence distance. It can be seen by reference to Figure 3. that:
Convergence distance = ft
On

It must be noted that the brain's interpretation of the twin-channel visual
information supplied by the eyes is not solely based on the above geometric
principles, but is also influenced by other factors and in particular by prior
knowledge of the shape of familiar objects. When we are dealing with abstract
images, the mathematical basis is closely followed; when dealing with known
subjects and particularly images of human figures, the brain tends to modify
impressions in order to make the images fit in with prior concepts. In practice
we have found that for shape ratios not exceeding 2, the viewer can normally
accept that the image is a good representation of the original. We have
Suggested guidelines for the matching of the left and right pictures, and for the
control of depth and shape reproduction.324 We have found that, if these
are adhered to, 3-D pictures can be comfortably used over long periods of time.
4. FIRST PROTOTYPE SYSTEM AND EVALUATIONS
4.1 Prototype Camera:
The first engineered systems to be made to the suggested guidlines have been
evaluated in non-radioactive conditions in facilities within the UKAEA and CEGB.
The camera uses four solid-state cameras arranged in 2 pairs, to give wide and
narrow angle stereo pictures. The focus and convergence of the cameras are
linked so that both pairs are focussed and converged on the same plane, a single
front panel switch movement operates focus and convergence for both cameras.
This makes control of the camera relatively simple.
4.2 Prototype Display:
Consideration was given to all of the known methods of display for stereoscopic
images. Many of these were set up experimentally in our laboratory in order to
ensure that the best method achievable was used. The display eventually chosen
uses two monitors set at right angles and viewed through a semi-reflective
mirror. Polarizing filters at the monitor faces and in spectacles worn by the
viewer separate the left and right images. The spectacles are lightweight and
are similar in appearance to sunglasses or corrective spectacles. The display
was designed to meet the rigorous picture matching requirements referred to
above. This was achieved by careful and rugged mechanical design, and by
selection of high quality monitors which allowed the necessary degree of picture
adjustment.
4.3 Evaluations:
Preliminary evaluations at Windscale Laboratory showed a 23% improvement in the
time taken to complete a typical decommissioning task - cropping a reinforcement
bar - via a remotely-operated industrial robot in a mock-up facility. The
facility is designed to test and develop equipment for nuclear decommissioning,
particularly with respect to the decommissioning of the pressure vessel of
Windscale's Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (WAGR). These evaluations have been
reported fully previously». In addition to the time reduction recorded, the
Study showed a number of other results. Examination of video tapes made of the
operations showed that the reduction in time for stereo was linked to fewer
discrete movements of the robot. This suggests that operators had better control
of the remote operation and might make fewer errors as a result. A number of
operators who used the equipment during these trials and other operations
expressed a preference to work with the 3-D system.

In addition to formal evaluations, one of the two prototype systems has been used
for an extended time in a remote operations facility at the CEGB's Marchwood
Laboratory. This has provided an opportunity to check the Stability and
performance of the camera and display in the hands of operators with no expert
knowledge of television equipment. Regular inspection has shown no routine
requirements to set up the camera mechanism. Minor drift in monitor geometric
alignment noticed after one years use was small enough not to give operational
problems and was easily corrected. The display contrast and brightness controls
which need to be carefully matched on the two monitors had been locked off during
installation so had not been adjusted by operators. The settings had not drifted
significantly during the 18 months of use. Part of the design philosophy had
been that the operator should not be able to change settings that are not
essential for operations. This has been largely confirmed by trials, operators
have not expressed a wish for more adjustments, and the equipment has stayed
wel] set up.
5. CAMERA DEVELOPMENT

A requirement to develop a fully engineered colour camera, subsequent to the
production of the first black-and-white cameras, has provided the opportunity to
incorporate some of the refinements to the original designs suggested by the
mock-up evaluations and operational experience. The cameras have been built and
were used for the second series of trials at Windscale Laboratory. The camera
has included: the choice of automatic or manual iris controls; a mechanism
accurately linking focus and convergence, convergence is achieved by axial offset
of the lens so no trapezium errors are suffered; mechanically linked iris
control giving very accurate iris matching; the position feedback of the focus
mechanism which has been used to provide a binocular range-finding facility. The
camera uses two re-packaged single-sensor solid-state cameras and a range of
photographic lenses which make angles-of-view from 30° to 8° available. As with
the earlier cameras, video is transmitted via twisted pairs. The camera is
designed to allow radiation-tolerant sensors to be fitted to give a radiation-
tolerant and environmentally sealed version.

6. DISPLAY DEVELOPMENT
The polarized light displays use two modified picture monitors set at right
angles and viewed via a beam-splitting mirror. Polarized light filters at the
monitor face and in spectacles worn by viewers separate the two pictures.
These have proved to give good quality pictures which are comfortable to view and
with no operational difficulties. We anticipate that this display will be the
preferred option for serious use of 3-D television over the next few years,
because of its high standard of performance. Some applications may demand
smaller displays for a given size of screen. In this case we now believe that a
time-division display of acceptable quality could be made, but at considerable
financial cost. The display would be required to show a video at twice the
normal rate and suitable framestores would be needed to buffer the video, if
conventional cameras where to be used. This would give anomalous picture
components for moving objects, but we believe that picture quality could be
acceptable for most subjects. The polarity switching should be carried out at
the monitor face, with polarizing spectacles being worn by the viewer. Care must
be taken in the choice of picture phosphor and polarizing materials to keep
cross-talk between the left and right pictures to an acceptable level. Auto-
Stereoscopic displays are feasible; an autostereoscopic TV display has been

demonstrated at Harwell. An image-forming screen transmits the left and right
pictures to the eyes without the need for a viewing aid to be worn (though the
viewer's head position must be reasonably fixed to obtain the 3-D view).
The colour polarized light display developed at Harwell, see Figure 5, is a
development of the original black and white display, but using broadcast quality
colour monitors which have preset controls for allowing control of the picture
shape. By collaboration with the manufacturer, the important preset controls for
each monitor have been brought out to a lockable control panel on the top of the
displays; this can be seen in Figure 5. A test pattern generator has been
included in the system so that the operator can follow a relatively simple
procedure to check, and if necessary, adjust the geometry, colour and grey level
of the monitors so they are well set up and matched. A cross-hatch pattern is
displayed on both monitors to allow geometry comparison - the scan circuits of
the two monitors are adjusted until the two patterns exactly overlay. A
stereoscopic version of picture line-up generator (PLUGE) signal is used for grey
scale alignment signals are asent to the top half of the right monitor and the
bottom half of the left. The grey scales are thus displayed on one monitor each.
The display is viewed without spectacles so the two scales can be compared.
Further details have been given elsewhere. °
We anticipate that some training for operators to carry out the set-up would be
required, in addition to concise written instructions. Similar developments have
been incorporated into new black and white displays. Broadcast monitors are used
and circuitry has been specially developed to enable geometric matching of the
two pictures with the aid of the cross-hatch pattern generator. The electronic
controls remove the need to make adjustments to the picture tube and its
deflection assembly which require more skill.

7. EVALUATION OF 2ND GENERATION, COLOUR SYSTEM
Evaluations of this second generation, colour 3-D system, were carried out
at the Windscale facility.® A task was based on an operation planned as
part of decommissioning WAGR; two heavy steel plates were to be moved between
stands and a ‘toast rack' using an overhead gantry crane. The task involved
rotation and accurate positioning of the plates, One was a curved piece of
thermal shielding 5cm thick, and the other was flat and 8cm thick. Respectively,
these were to be inserted into slots 8cm and 8.3cm wide. Two television views
were provided - a main view looking along the slots from 1.6m above the toast
rack and an oblique supplementary view - based on camera positions possible for
the real operation. The supplementary view was always in 2-D but the main view
could be either 2-D or 3-D.
Six operators were timed using both 3-D and 2-D. Half used the 3-D first, the
others 2-D. In turn, with each viewing system, the operators moved the curved
plate from stand to toast rack, the flat plate to the toast rack and then
returned both to their stands. The sequence was then repeated. For analysis,
the task was split into sub-components. This showed that the part of the task
which required the most positional accuracy benefitted most from 3-D TV. This
was the part of the task where the plates were aligned with the toast rack; a 17%
time improvement was found for 3-D.

A questionnaire was completed by the six timed operators plus two more who had
also used both the 2-D and 3-D arrangements. The 3-D was highly rated on picture
quality and ease of use. All] except one had preferred using 3-D and would have
been happy to do so for extended periods. Some operators commented that the 2-D
views could have been better placed - plan and elevation views would have been
preferred - but with 3-D, the camera positions were satisfactory. This is in
accord with earlier findings that the positioning of a single 3-D view is far
less critical than the optimal siting of a pair of 2-D views. A fuller report of
this trial has been published recentiy.5
8. CONCLUSIONS FROM EVALUATIONS AND OPERATING EXPERIENCE
The experience of trials and operations shows that 3-D TV systems give a number
of benefits for remote handling:
- A reduction in the number of views (cameras) required
- Faster operational times, with greater improvements for elements requiring
alignment
- Fewer manipulator movements for a given task, suggesting that fewer errors
and collisions would be made
- Positioning of cameras is less critical with 3-D
- Operator preference for 3-D (no ill effects)
Furthermore we can hypothesize that operators are better able to interpret
unfamiliar scenes with 3-D TV. From observations made during evaluations, we
have made a number of refinements to the designs of the systems which have been
incorporated into the second and third generation systems.
9. DEVELOPMENT OF A 3RD GENERATION, IN-REACTOR AND IN-CELL CAMERA
The ultimate aim of the development work on 3-D TV systems is to provide
systems which can be used for a variety of nuclear applications including,
inspection of gas-cooled reactors; post-irradiation examination and _ fuel-
reprocessing facilities; and decommissioning. The specification for a camera to
work in these environments was produced by consulting with experts on remote
viewing systems within the UK nuclear industry. The specification encompassed
the temperature requirement to 150°C with chilled air cooling, lighting
requirements, materials and mechanical constraints. The camera has angles-
of-view of 40° and 10° and converges and focusses down to 300mm for the
wide angle-of-view. Cable lengths of up to 100m are allowed for. The target
radiation-tolerance is 106Gy with dose rates to 104Gy/hour. This figure
requires future confirmation by experiment. We did consider and experiment with
the use of zoom lenses for this camera. We believe that it is possible to use
zoom lenses in fully engineered and remotely controlled 3-D cameras. However we
found that we could not obtain a suitable radiation-tolerant zoom lens because of
the limited range commercially available.
The camera manufacture was completed during 1989 and jis currently undergoing
trials prior to use in an active facility. The size requirement for the camera

combined with the use of two sets of fixed focal length lenses for two angles-
of-view has meant that the mechanical linking of convergence and focus used in
the earlier cameras was not appropriate and that full computer control of the
system was required. Computer control is needed because the axial offset
required for convergence, and the displacement of the lens relative to the
pick-up for focus are different for the two focal lengths. The combined focus
and convergence control, designed for simple operation, has been retained.
However with computer control it is possible to remove this link, which is made
in software and is purely for the convenience of the operator. This would allow
an experienced operator to move the focus distance away from the plane of
convergence as the desirable focus plane may differ from the optimum convergence
plane in certain scenes. Computer control allows a number of other advanced
features to be incorporated in the camera design such as monitoring of camera
temperature, coolant flow, lens status, and automatic readout of convergence
distance at the control panel. The camera is shown in Figure 6.
10. VIDEO TAPE RECORDING OF 3-D TV PICTURES
3-D pictures can be recorded in a number of ways. Two tapes can be synchronized
on two high quality machines with a suitable edit controller. This method can
give very good results, but is expensive and requires that two tapes are kept
together. Some degree of skill is needed to record or play back. We have
demonstrated a satisfactory technique where left and right fields are recorded
alternately to the odd and even fields of the tape. The tape is then played back
via two frame stores which repeat fields, for example, the left field is repeated
once while the right field is being read from the tape. Developments in
video-tape recording of 3-D pictures have been reported elsewhere. /
11. CONCLUDING REMARKS
The trials and subsequent developments described here show that 3-D TV can
provide a useful tool for the assistance of remote handling operations, provided
that the rigorous design requirements are met. Development is already at a
stage where 3-D systems can be usefully employed to enable operators to carry out
remote operations more quickly and accurately than with conventional television.
