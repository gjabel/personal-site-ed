Condition 1, 3-D - The stereoscopic camera was
mounted obliquely to the task as shown.
Qperators were allowed to switch between wide and
harrow angles-of-view and to pan and tilt the |
camera. The narrow angle view just covered the 200mm

was used exciusively, pan and tiit motions would

Condition 2, Orthogonat Cameras - Two’ cameras
were placed at right angles to each other with
respect to the task and manipulator tool axis.
Informal trials were used to determine the
positions of the cameras. Whereas the 3-D camera
was found to give acceptable views at the first 4
try, two subsequent attemots were needed for the 7
orthogonal cameras. The cameras were originally
mounted further forward, but this gave operators
orientation problems. 30th orthogonal cameras
had fixed focal-length lenses, giving a slightly :
larger angle-of-view than the 3-0 narrow angle,
so that the task could be completed without
panning and tilting the cameras. For both TV
conditions lighting was fixed and not within the
operator's control. 6
