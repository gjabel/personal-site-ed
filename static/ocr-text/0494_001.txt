Workshop on Telerobotics - A visual definition of current capabilities = -— Nass
Washington, DC 7-9 November 1989
The Remote Handling and Robotics Group at AEA Technology’s Harwell Laboratory carries out
contract research and development into robotics, advanced teleoperation and television
systems. Research concentrates on
* telerobotics * servo systems
* systems integration * radiation tolerance
¢ 3-D television ¢ simulation
* man-machine interface * control systems
e communications * imaging
Our prime objective is to provide effective solutions that can be adopted by nuclear facility
designers and operators, and our approach to remote handling is to
* use off-the shelf solutions
* adapt and modify existing equipment
¢ develop special equipment
Currently, our main development, focuses on telerobotics and 3-D TV. We define
telerobotics as combining all that is best in industrial robotics with all the skills of a human
operator to respond to ill-defined and unpredictable tasks. To produce low cost nuclear
environment telerobotics we have designed and built the Harwell Input Controller, a
386-based system which accepts input commands from joysticks or, for example, a six degree
of freedom force ball, and allows an operator to drive an industrial robot in all six degrees of
freedom under joint, world or tool co-ordinator” systems. Joint limits and singularities are
managed. We are building a Nuclear Engineered Advanced TeleRobot [NEATER] which is a
modified industrial robot re-engineered to be suitable for use in many nuclear environments,
Finally, we have designed and built successful stereoscopic [3-D] TV Systems which are
easy to use for long periods of time and do not produce the discomfort associated with early
systems.
Our visual definition will show some of the developments at Harwell in telerobotic
decommissioning trials, human factors evaluations of 3-D TV, features of the robot input
controller for adaptive control, and performance of the specially developed hydraulic
manipulator.
Although the majority of work is related to the nuclear fuel cycle, waste management and
decommissioning, we have carried out contract R&D into advanced robotics and space
teleoperation.
