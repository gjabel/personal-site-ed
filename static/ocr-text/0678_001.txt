41. Basic principles
There are essentially two basic systems for the magnetic levitation
and guidance of high speed tracked vehicies which are at present receiving
serious investigation world-wide, namely a
i) the electromagnetic system (EMS),
ii) the electrodynamic system (EDS).
The EMS is based essentially on the attractive forces between conven-
tional copper magnets with iron yokes on the vehicle and iron rails along
the track. Because this is basically an unstable system, active control
of the magnet currents is essential to maintain the clearance between the
magnets and the rail, a distance of approximately 10 - 15 mm.
The EDS, on the other hand,relies for levitation and guidance on the
repulsive forces which are generated between moving iron-free, supercon-
ducting magnets on the vehicle and conducting (aluminium) sheets (or coils)
at ambient temperature on the track. In its application to high speed
transport, some of the essential features of the EDS can be enumerated as
follows:
1) The vehicle is magnetically levitated and laterally guided in a
statically stable manner solely by magnetic forces generated in the
aluminium guideway by the vehicle magnets.
2) The clearance between the vehicle and the guideway can be in the range
of 100- 400mm.
3) The levitation and guidance forces are analogous to those produced by
‘ a resilient undamped spring with a resonant frequency of the order
of 1-2 Hz.
4) The circulating currents induced in the aluminium guideway give rise
to magnetic drag forces which have to be overcome by the propulsion system.
5) The superconducting magnets on the vehicle operate at liquid helium
temperature (4.2K) in the persistent (short-circuited) mode and hence
require no power on-board. e
6) At standstill and lew speeds up to approximately 40 - 50 km/h, wheels
are necessary to support the vehicle.
7) From the point of view of the efficiency of a linear motor operating
with air gaps of the order of 100mm, a linear synchronous motor would
be used, the powered armature windings being installed along the track.

8) Power conditioning units spaced at intervals (5 - 15 km) would
provide the three-phase current to the track windings which
interacts with the vehicle superconducting magnets.

9) Various schemes for combining linear motor propulsion and guidance
or, in the case of the Warwick design, combined propulsion, lift

« and guidance, are being examined.

2. Magnetic force characteristics

For a magnet moving at constant height above the conducting strip
guideway, the lift force, Fhe first increases az ve, where V =
velocity and, as the induced currents in the track become saturated,
it then levels off and approaches the image force, Bye at speeds
greater than about 120 km/h, i.e. the lift force becomes independent .
of speed Fig (1 ).

Because the aluminium track is resistive, energy is dissipated by
the induced currents. This appears as a drag force which increases
linearly with speed initially reaching a maximum at 10 - 20 km/h ,
depending on tne vehicle coil geometry and thickness of the aluminium
track, At higher speeds it decreases hyperbolically as (velocity) -3
(v7?), It is this decrease in magnetic drag at the higher speeds which
allows the EDS suspension to function efficiently.

& number of fundamental studies of current-carrying coils moving
above conducting sheets of varying geometries and arrangements have
been carried out and there is considerable information on the variation
of wagnetic lift, Fis and drag, Fy: forces with vehicle speed, levitation
height and Coil geometry. It can be shown in general that

i _ oY
Ky ~  oW
over the whole speed range, where W is a characteristic velocity associated
with the guideway size, thickness, material and configuration. With a
simple magnet-track arrangement , Fi/y, mm 35 can be technically achieved
at 500 km/h. It is evident, therefore, that the propulsion force required
to overcome magnetic drag decreases with increasing speed while, at high
speeds, the force needed to overcome the aerodynamic drag increases as Vv“,
and accounts for most of the energy expenditure.
-~3-

2e1 Lift and guidance
A variety of arrangements of the vehicle magnets and guideway
conducting sheet or loops have been examined and these essentially
fall into two groups,
i) single magnets above plane sheets or strips of aluminium in the
° normal flux arrangements (the Japanese use conducting coiis in
the track in place of continuous strips).
ii)  muli-flux systems whereby double magnets on the vehicle, excited
in opposition, induce currents in a stripor loop track positioned
between them.
The main advantage of the null-flux system, i.e. a reduced drag
force, tends to be compensated by the larger magnetic fields
required for the vehicle magnets. Some of the different coil/
guideway configurations being studied are sketched in Fig. ( 2)
and a comparison of their design details is given in Table ( 1?.
2e2 Damping
Although the EDS systems are statically self-stabilizing, their
self-damping is insufficient to compensate for dynamic instabilities
caused by wind forces, track irregularities and other external perturba-
tions. To meet the criteria for ride comfort, therefore, some additional
active control must be provided in the critical frequency range 0.5 - 20 Hz.
These damping requirements can be achieved either by additional actively~
controlled coils mounted between the superconducting coils and the track
or by means of a passive or active secondary suspension system. It is
planned tc examine both of these possibilities at Warwick and some prelimin-
ary studies have been started.

3. Vehicle dynamics
The split-track system being developed at Warwick combines the
functions of lift, guidance and propulsion from a single array of
superconducting magnets on the vehicle moving over a pais of aluminium
strip ‘rails' on the track with a powered armature winding in the gap
between them (Fig. (3). From an analysis of a mathematical model of
the system, together with impedance model measurements, it has been .
shown that the predicted behaviour and performance characteristics
are equivalent to alternative electrodynamic suspension schemes and,
in many respects, can be superior.
301 Impedance Modelling
The impedance modelling technique has been extensively used to
study the magnetic force characteristics produced by the two-coii
assembly of the Wolfson test vehicle being constructed for operation
on the 550 m-long, test track on the university campus. Two copper-
wound coils, O.4m square, positioned in tandem (Fig. (4) and of opposite
polarity are mounted above two aluminium ‘track’ strips and the apparent
inductance and resistance of the coils are measured at different positions
relative to the guideway strips. The lift and guidance forces are
related to the gradient of inductance, the drag to the resistance and the
speed to the frequency. The impedance method readily lends itself to
full-scale modelling and, although the simulation of a moving d.c. excited
coil by a stationary a.c. coil in a model can never be exact, it has been
found in practice, that the results are in good agreement with theoretical
predictions.
: A number of experiments have been performed to determine the character-
istics of the split-track geometry and also to confirm the predictions of
the mathematical model of the systems. These include measurements of
i) the lift-to-drag ratiosas a function of the conductor spacing,
cynductor width and thickness, levitation height, and frequency (speed).
ii) the guidance forces and the variation of lateral stiffness.
iii) heave frequencies :
iv) the effect of guideway joints
The variation of the influential coil dynamic characteristics with
conductor spacing is shown in Fig. (5), Roll stiffness and lift are
essentially independent of conductor spacing while the lift-to-drag ratio
and lateral stiffness are highly dependent. To generate desirable roll
characteristics therefore only requires manipulation of the coil width,
while the lateral stiffness is determined from the spacing between the
o Oe

conductors. To produce the required lift-to-drag ratio it is then
necessary to thicken the track or increase the conductor width. In
this manner any combination of coil dynamic characteristics can be
obtained. It has also been found that cross-coupling between roll and
Sideslip is extremely small for the conductor spacings cf interest while
lift variation with lateral displacement is small. The Warwick

. geometry is the only electrodynamic system yet devised in which these
latter terms are small enough to be ignored. Since, for many practical

reasons of design and fabrication, a circular geometry for the super-
conducting coils and their cryostat assemblies is preferred to rec-
tangular shapes, the force characteristics of these were examined.
Design criteria have been established for finite radius, rectangular
coils, as designed for magiev trains, by both an analytical approach
and by impedance modelling. Measurements have been made of the effect
on the lift-toedrag ratio and guidance stiffness using circular coil
and rounded corner geometries.

4, Ride Quality

Track roughness and cross-wind gusts have a major influence on
the attainment of satisfactory comfort levels for passengers travelling
in high speed trains. To assess the impact of such external disturb-
ances on vehicle behaviour a simple mathematical model of the suspencion
has been subjected to a random input and the power spectral density (p.s.d.) .
output response then compared with the UTACV ride standard for passenger
comfort. For this analysis the vehicle and suspension are simulated by :
a two-dimensional heave model as shown in Fig. (6). The purely passive
suspension is considered although the air springs envisaged for the
secondary suspension readily allow for active control of the damping.

To represent the lateral motion of the vehicle, the heave model is
merely turned through a right angle, as it is assumed in the calculations
that no coupling exists between the vertical and lateral motions. This
assumption has been shown to be valid for small oscillations from the
impedance modelling results for the coil characteristics. It is also
assumed that an unsteady cross-wind acts entirely on the secondary mass.
For this study the mass ratio, M&M (= M2/y4) was set at 4 where
represents the primary mass, consisting of the magnet/cryostat assemblies,
and Ms the vehicle mass. (In the Canadian design, the total weight was
20 tonnes, including 5.1t for the magnet array and 1.5t for the secondary
mechanical suspension).

In all cases the output p.s.d. response is given by :

dout= Mw) J 6 in
where H(w) is the transfer function relatingthe output to the input.
» P=

5. Track roughness

The input spectrum from a rough track is usually given in the form

where U = velocity of the vehicle
a and A = a constant = 1.5 x 10 “6

However, it has been found that a better fit to the available data is
, given by an input spectrum of the form

g ( w) = AU
2 2
Wo + W

where Wo corresponds to a low frequency cut-off.

The output peSed. has been obtained for four primary stiffness
values between 0.75 x 40° and 3.0 x 40° Nm “1 while maintaining the
secondary stiffness at 0.75 x 40° Na “1 The latter primary stiffness,
corresponds to a natural frequency of 1.6 Hz for a 30t vehicle, with a
secondary suspension frequency of 0.8 Hz (air springs could be used to
obtain this frequency).

A number of velocity spectra have been proposed for longitucinal
wind velocities in the lower part of the atmosphere and it was found that
the most suitable for this study was the one most commonly used for
‘building' aerodynamics. The acceleration p.s.d.‘s for a 13.5 me | cross-
wind input were calculated for the suspensions previously considered.
Likewise, the combined (track plus cross-wind input) lateral and vertical
peSed. curves were obtained for different values of the lateral and
vertical primary stiffness ratios. From a comparison with the UTACV
standards, it would appear that a reasonably good ride would be
obtained.

If active control is thought to be desirable to produce a satisfactory
ride then the amount of active power required is small, because the p.s.d.
curve exceeds the standard only slightly over a very narrow frequency range.

° This is in contrast to the electromagnetic system where the primary
stiffness is sufficiently high so that active control of the secondary
_o suspension is essential.

6. Aerodynamic characteristics

Aerodynamic forces and moments have an important effect on the
behaviour and performance of a high speed vehicle and a study of vehicle
shapes has been undertaken using small scale models. For example, a
vehicie travelling at 135 me” | with frontal area 9 m* would experience a
10 tonne force for a force coefficient, Cy = 1.0. All the tests were .
carried out in the 0.9m square, low-speed wind-tunnel at the Lanchester
Polytechnic. The forces and moments were measured on the models using
a 6=-component balance mounted within the ground plane. An overhead |
balance was also used for some of the measurements and a range of model
lengths and tail shapes as shown in Fig. (7) were studied.

It was also found from these experiments that the vehicle experiences a
large increase in lift when subjected to a cross-wind. This leads toa
reduction in the restoring forces of the magnetic suspension and hence to
less vehicle stability. Experiments were therefore set up to examine the
influence of the vehicle body, cross section on the lift at four angles. .
The influence of different nose shapes on the aerodynamic behaviour were

| also investigated.

A problem yet to be resolved concerns the validity of conventional
wind-tunnel testing with regard to the simulation of the ground effect
and an experimental programme has been started to assess the errors likely
to occur in conventional static ground testing of elongated bodies. Two
approaches to this problem are being followed, a) the pressure distribution
and forces will be measured on a 1/10th scale model running on the Wolfson
test track. These results will be compared with measurements made on the
same model in the low-speed industrial wind-tunnel at City University,

b) measurements are being taken on a smaller scale model (1m long) running
on a track constructed in the laboratory (18m long).

?e Rotating-wheel test facility

During the early stages of the Warwick maglev project analytical and
computer studies were undertaken to assess the feasibility of the levita-
tion and propulsion system. Modelling and small scale experiments were
carried out to gain a better understanding of the theoretical predictions.

o However, in order to improve the accuracy of the measurements and to
provide more realistic test data a large rotating wheel was designed and

” constructed. The essential magnetic force characteristics of the split-
track levitation and guidance system being proposed at Warwick and predicted
by mathematical analysis could now be confirmed.

In this 'splitetrack' design the vehicle guideway configuration
(Fig. (3))utilizes a single set of superconducting magnets on the
vehicle, interacting with two, separated, conducting aluminium 'track'
strips for the generation of the levitation and guidance forces. Active
power meander windings laid between the strips interact with the vehicle
magnets to produce the necessary propulsion in thrust force. Although the
lift and drag forces generated in a simple (infinite sheet) configuration
have been extensively analyzed in theory and experiment, a complex guideway
arrangement, like the Warwick split-track configuration in which the
influence of the edge effects on the induced eddy currents is dominant,
has not been fully studied in detail. This is partly due to the excessive
computer times that would be involved and the research has therefore been
concentrated on the impedance modelling technique. Using this method a
larger number of results of the system characteristics, extending over a
wide range of vehicle speeds, have now been accummulated.

The rotating wheel facility has recently been completed and commissioned
and a test programme has recently been started to obtain the experimental
data to validate the results of the impedance modelling technique.

71 Design details
The rotating wheel facility consists of the following major components,
a) the wheel
» b) support structure
c) drive motor
° d) superconducting magnet and force balance harness
e) two aluminium levitation strips.
a) The wheel

A view of the rig and magnet assembly are shown in Fig. (8) and the design
specifications are listed in Tables (II) and (III) respectively.

=-10—

To satisfy the requirement of non-magnetic materials used in the
construction the design consisted of a laminated wooden rim with an overall
diameter of 3m, reinforced with glass-fibre/epoxy resin and supported by
eight aluminium angle spokes,
b) Support structure
Plummer blocks, housing the bearings, are mounted on steel plates e
which have been anchored to two reinforced concrete plinths. The support-
ing plinths for the motor and shaft system are shown in Fig. (8). ‘
c) Motor drives
The wheel is driven by a doc. motor directly coupled to the shaft;
speedcontrol, loading/braking, etc. are achieved by means of the variable
voltage control provided by the Ward-Leonard method, e.g. by varying the
field current the motor can be made to act as either motor or generator,
thereby either driving or loading the wheel.
d) Superconducting magnet and harness
A single superconducting coil, 150mm square, and contained in a
commercial cryostat is mounted on the force balance, located above the test
wheel on a fixed portal frame (Fig. (8). The magnet was successfully
tested to liquid helium temperature and the field measurements of the
energized coil showed good agreement with the design specification. The
characteristics of the coil are listed in Table (IIT), The magnet harness
and force measuring balance enable measurements of the magnetic forces
to be made in the 6 degrees of freedom, i.e. lift, drag, lateral forces,
pitch, roll and yaw mements.
e) Split-track aluminium cenductors.
Two aluminium hoops (approximately 3m diameter) were formed from
‘ 6 welded strips. These were thermally shrunk to the rim of the wheel with
a gap of 110mm separating the inner edges. The hoops have been designed to
withstand the combined stresses due to the centrifugal forces of the rotating
wheel up to 45 ms” and the thermal expansion produced by induced eddy
currents. The results obtained from the impedance modelling technique have
indicated that the influence of the welded joints of the aluminium strips on
the lift/drag force measurements should be negligible. “
A digital electronic control unit has been designed, and is at present
being built, to replace the existing manual control of the wheel. This
unit will be capable of accepting programmed jerk, acceleration and velacity
profiles.
Analytical investigations on a design of a linear synchronous motor for
experimental testing on the wheel facility have been completed. For these
o11-

measurements an array of five superconducting coils will be mounted
on a force harness above the wheel and these will interact with a ~
3-phase winding fixed to the periphery of the wheel and powered by a
variable frequency supply. The results of this design study have been
presented in an internal memo.

8. Linear synchronous motor propulsion
For environmental and other reasons only the linear electric motor

is being considered for the propulsion of high-speed maglev vehicles and,

in principle, there is a choice between the short stator induction

machine, or the long stator synchronous machine. However, for the electro- °

dynamic system of levitation, utilizing superconducting magnets, the iron-

free, long stator, synchronous motor would seem to offer the most promising
solution.
The principal advantages of the LSM are as follows:

i) No power collection is required for the energy supply on the vehicle,
i.e. the super conducting field magnets operating in the persistent
mode, consume no energy except for minor thermal losses.

ii) The air-gap between the armature track windings and the vehicle magnets
can be of the same order as the levitation height to attain reasonable
efficiencies, i.e. 100 - 250 mm.

iii) Since only lightweight,iron-'free' magnets are carried on the vehicles,
the overall weight is considerably less than with the conventional
electromagnetic propulsion systems.

The basic mode of operation of the LSM is shown diagramatically in Fig. (9).

Conventional flexible power cables are laid between the aluminium strips

slong the track in a meander pattern, to form a three-phase winding which

thus generates a travelling electromagnetic wave. The vehicle magnets
interact with this travelling electromagnetic wave so that the vehicle

speed is synchronized with that of the wave, this latter being determined

by the exciting frequency and the pole~pitch of the winding. The energy to

the winding is fed in at intervals of 5 to 15 km from subestation frequency
converters, providing the current and variable frequency.
Since both horizontal thrust and a vertical force are generated by

the motor, these two components can be adjusted independently of each other

by the current in the armature winding and by the position of the vehicle

magnets relative to the travelling waves, as measured by the slip angle. .

Hence, the thrust and velocity of the vehicle can be controlled from the

trackside. Likewise, because of the vertical force produced, some control

of the dynamic behaviour of the vehicle in heave motion is also possible,
€og- by controlling the slip angle. It has been shown that high machine
efficiencies and power factors are possible with this design of LSM,

Coe n = 0.88 and cos? = 0.93 at an optimum
working point of ) = 123° have been calculated and confirmed in
scaled model tests. '
t

By the use of superconducting pole windings on the vehicle, high
magnetic fields can be generated over a large volume (large airgap) and
hence the power requirements for the primary windings in the track are
reduced to a reasonable level. Typical LSM/magnet coils operate with
approximately SOOkKAT at air gaps of 100 ~- 250 mm, producing 0.25 - 0.8T
at the track conductor level.

9. LSM research
In the early stages of the Warwick project an alternative propulsion
system was investigated, namely the linear counterpart of the thyristor-=
commutator d.c. machine. Its main advantage is that, since the length
of track winding excited at any time is relatively short (of the order
of the vehicle length), the power factor and efficiency are both high or, “
alternatively, fewer superconducting coils would be required on the vehicles
An analytical study of thislinear commutator machine (LCM) was under~
taken which was concentrated on an adaptation of the standard d.c. machine
analysis. In parallel with these theoretical studies a demonstration
machine was constructed with windings around the periphery of a 0.5m
diameter drum. A superconducting magnet, mounted over the wheel, provided
the field excitation. This was the first demonstration ever reported of
this type of linear machine and it should be noted that the Japanese are
now using a similar LSM design for their maglev test vehicle.
The main features of the LCM which differ from those of the long
stator LSM are,
i) the short, excited armature length and ii) the fact that the power
conversion of switching equipment is distributed in small blocks at short
intervals along the track whereas, for the LSM, much larger inverter units
are located at longer intervals of a few kilometres, typically 5 - 15 km.
In an attempt to resolve these differences a cost analysis was
carried out and a comparative study was made with other LSM machine designs,
iee. the Canadian and the MIT LSM designs.

However, in view of recent developments in pulsed current inverters,
the decision was taken by the Warwick Group, to transfer the research
effort from the LCM to the LSM. The latter appeared to offer the better
prospects as a propulsion system for the Warwick split track design and
therefore analytical studies of the performance capabilities and topolog-
ical variation of a LSM propulsion were undertaken. These studies will be
fully published in a forthcoming report.

10. A.C. losses in the superconducting coils

In the application of superconducting magnets for the levitation,
guidance and propulsion of high-speed vehicles, the coils will be
subjected to time-varying fluctuations superimposed on their d.c. bias
fields because of field variations resulting from various external sources,

. acting on the vehicle,such as track irregularities, wind gusts, etc.
Furthermore, the vehicle magnets will see the periodically-modulated,
inductance coupling with the powered track winding of the ISM armature.
All these variations in the magnetic environment of the magnets, super-
imposed on their constant flux (persistent current) mode, would result in
the generation of power losses.

A research programme is being undertaken jointly with the Rutherford
Laboratory to investigate and develop experimental techniques suitable
for the measurement of ac. losses in multifilamentary superconducting
wires. The main objective of this research is to improve the under-
standing of the different loss mechanisms as a function of the physical
geometry and metallurgical treatment of the superconducting materials.

The helium boil-off technique is being used to measure the losses in
short samples and non-inductively wound samples are also being used for
determining the self-field losses over the frequency range up to 100 Ha.
A number of interesting results have been obtained to date and the
apparatus is at present being modified to improve the sensitivity in the
very low frequency rangee

Vie Woifson test facility

11.1 Guideway
A guideway structure for the testing of model vehicles has been
: constructed on the university campus over a distance of 550m (Fig. 10 de

The construction consists of concrete piers at 5m intervals, spanned by
timber joists and finished with a timber deck (1.3m wide). The dynamic .
deflection at centre span is less than Smm for a 500 kg vehicle.

Aluminium strips (200 x 10mm), spaced 380mm apart, serve as the running
rails for the maglev test vehicle. Propulsion for the vehicle is
provided by a towed trolley being attached to a continuous cable driven
through a capstan by a stationary petrol engine (Fig. (10)).

The test vehicle is mounted on the trolley by means of flexible
bearings so that its dynamic behaviour can be measured, using miniature
tape recorders for recording the readings of force-measuring transducers.
11.2 Test vehicle

A model vehicle (3m long, weighing 150 kg), consisting essentially
of a stream-lined glass-fibre body shell, with provision for the super
conducting magnets, has been constructed and tested on the track up to
a speed of 35 veil
11.3 Superconducting coils and cryostat assembly

Two superconducting coils (0.4 x O.4m) and their helium cryostat
assembly have been constructed and are presently being tested. The coils
themselves are contained in a welded, stainless-steel vessel with helium
cooling for several hours operation. Up to 18 litres of liquid helium is
stored in three cylindrical vessels extending the length of the cryostat,
Fig. (11). By sealing the cryostat and allowing the helium gas pressure
to rise to 2 atmospheres an operation time of from 3 - 4 hrs. without
helium replenishment has been calculated. A stainless steel radiation
shield and liquid nitrogen reservoir surround the coils in the vacuum
space. The coils will be operated under short circuit conditions by means
of a heavy copper, shorting connection across the terminals (Table 4).
11.4 Problems of magnet design

By virtue of the application of superconducting magnets for the
suspension and propulsion of a high speed vehicle, they would be subjected
to severe dynamic conditions and hence the design of the coils and their
cryostat assembly differ radically in several important respects from the

a We

conventiona] designs for stationary operation. For the split-track Jevitation/
guidance system in particular, square or rectangular coils are necessary.
This, in itself, presents new problems in providing mechanical reinforcement
apainst the very high magnetic forces generated in the straight-sided
_limbs of the coils. By contrast, these problems are very much easier in

2 the case of circular coils where the forces are uniformly distributed.
The design problem is further compounded by the constructional and operational
difficulties associated with the sharp corners of the coils, the migration
of the winding and stress concentration. A study was undertaken to
establish design criteria for finite radius rectangular coils, using both
the stress analysis technique and impedance modelling measurements and the
general conclusion from this study was that a reduction in lift-to-drag
ratio of the vehicle must be accepted with increasing corner radius in order
to maintain the same guidance stiffness. Another consideration is that the
coil shape, to a large extent, determines the geometry of the cryostat
assembly which, in the Warwick design, consists of the two square coils,
housed in a tandem arrangement inside a rectangular vacuum box, together
with the nitrogen thermal shield and helium storage vessels. Very severe
mechanical problems associated with the large flat areas of the vacuum
vessels had to be overcome and, in particular, because of the limited
distance between the coils and the aluminium track the vacuum and thermal
insulation for the helium vessel had to be severely restricted in the design.
A further difficulty which is not normally encountered in the design of
conventional superconducting magnets is that of the transmission of the
mechanical support forces from the coils at liquid helium temperature
(4.2K) through the vacuum thermal insulation to the outside of the cryostat
at ambient temperature. No previous experience in solving these design
problems could be found in the U.K. However, with the advice and considerable
help that has been received from the Rutherford Laboratory, most of these
difficulties have now been resolved and it is confidently expected that the
cool-down and operation of the magnets should now proceed without further
trouble.
