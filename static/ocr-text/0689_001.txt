Subject matter: 07.05 |
A trackball is a sphere mounted in a frame and free to turn about any
axis through its centre. Rotation of the trackball about any one of
three non-coplanar axes (which may be orthogonal) is detected by a |
respective detector, so that rotation about any axis is resolved into
three component rotations. The trackball may have a hole in one side
large enough to accommodate an operator's hand, and may be used at the |
master end of a master/slave manipulator to control the pitch, roll,
| and vaw motions of a slave arm, the link between the trackball and the
| slave arm preferably being electronic.
The detector of the rotation may be mechanical, optical, electromagneti
or magnetic. The mechanical detector might comprise a multiturn poten- |
tiometer turned by a wheel in frictional contact with the trackball, and
such a wheel may comprise a circular sheet of neoprene sandwiched betwean
rigid flanges. The optical detector might scan a pattern of dots or
lines on the surface of the trackball. The electromagnetic detector
might comprise a search coil surrounding the trackball, or a small
ferrite-cored search coil, with a primary coil inside the trackball
Supplied with an a.c. Signal, and the magnetic detector might comprise |
a reluctance detector scanning a dimpled ferromagnetic trackball.
|
Force feedback could also be provided by using a conducting material in |
the Se eee induction motors to create the feedback SORGes 4
