ABSTRACT
Two years ago, the Harwell Nuclear Robotics Programme was conceived by
consolidating some of the most appropriate technical areas from the
existing UKAEA's Active Handling Programme. After a thorough review of
robotics technology, several research topics were identified which needed
special attention. Communications, servo characterization, robot
enhancements, radiation tolerance and systems integration were selected as
areas where non-nuclear research was not adequate for successful
implementation of robotics to a wide range of nuclear facilities. This
paper focusses on these five areas, and describes how industrial standard-
based solutions will be examined and applied to active handling equipment.

ROBOTICS AND REMOTE HANDLING IN HOSTILE ENVIRONMENTS
PASCO, 27 MARCH - 2 APRIL 1987

INTRODUCTION
For the last 40 years, Harwell Laboratory has been the UK's centre for
nuclear remote handling research and development. In recent years, the
United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (CUKAEA] has realized that
conventional through-the-wall master slave manipulators [MSMs] and direct
viewing may no longer be the first choice combination for active handling,
due to more stringent safety requirements.
Future requirements for the nuclear fuel cycle, and other activities such
as inspection, maintenance and repair, refurbishment and decommissioning
have caused the UKAEA to redefine its strategy for manipulator
development. In doing so, cognizance is taken of the recent rapid
advances in micro-electronics, computing and robotics, all of which have
emerged as technologies in their own right, independent of the limiting
constraint of low growth in the nuclear industry. Significantly, by
adopting aspects of these technologies, it is possible to design remote
handling systems whose components are the result of a much wider
development effort, spread across many different industries. In addition,
although the UK has developed sophisticated manipulators for gas cooled
reactor inspection and repair, it remains unique among the majority of
nuclear power states in not having an indigenously produced nuclear
servomanipulator. Any new UK developments in computer aided teleoperation
are not therefore hampered by established equipment, designed before the
recent technology advances. The starting point for the design of a
manipulator is considerably different from the baseline drawn 30 years
ago, when there was virtually no recognized expertise appropriate to
remote handing, outside the nuclear industry,
The Harwell Nuclear Robotics Programme forms a subset of the UKAEA's
generic Active Handling Programme.* The aim of the Robotics Programme is
to identify the réle that robotic equipment, and the allied technologies
such as computing and control, can play in present and future nuclear
facilities, and to confirm design predictions by demonstration and
installation under realistic conditions. Spin-off into associated areas
such as space and “advanced robotics" have ensued.

THE NUCLEAR ROBOTICS PROGRAMME
The Programme is now in its second year. The first year's work consisted
of a comprehensive analysis of the enabling technologies for robotics and
advanced teleoperation. The technology areas [Cshown in Figure 1] were
chosen to allow the system designer easy access to a structured data base.
Because this study was the first-of-a-kind to analyse the UK nuclear
industry's requirements, recommendations for development were made for
each area. These formed the basis for the present year's research.
Radiation tolerance studies of industrial robots CIR] and their sub-
systems indicate that a wide range of peripheral nuclear activities exist
which could be carried out with only minor modifications to the robot.
Typical tasks such as: ,

e Jlow and intermediate level waste drum handling

® flask and pipework inspection

e AGR/PWR/FBR fuel fabrication

e filter changing

© posting/bagging-out operations

® decontamination

e glovebox decommissioning

e glovebox operations
require increasing levels of contamination control to be applied, and
would benefit from the addition of a real time hand controller for
programming or teleoperation.? Developments, particularly in the USA, 3-5
support this view. Other modifications, such as the addition of gaiters
[booting], or alternative methods of contamination control, and the
development of special purpose tooling would also be required.
It is natural to expect that a continued advantage could be gained if it
were possible to extend the ability of robots to tolerate more extreme
conditions. A robot, by virtue of its commerciality, is an optimized
mechanism designed to position and orientate a tool package in space. A
basic nuclear servomanipulator mechanism with force feedback may cost
three to five times as much as an IR with the same payload and reach
envelope [but without force feedback]. Before an IR can match nuclear

-?2-

servomanipulator performance in the majority of applications, deficiencies
in the way existing robots are designed and are operated have to be
resolved. Secondly, the environmental hazards have to be explicitly
described, and thirdly, the tolerance of robotic subsystems to the
environment must be understood.
The majority of robotics research is aimed at improving control] algorithms
or developing exotic sensors for vision, touch and feel. These
developments often take five to ten years before they are incorporated
into commercially available systems having a proven reliability. Improved
control would be of immediate benefit, as it would allow error recovery,
collision avoidance, higher level programming and trajectory control using
sensory feedback. Model Referenced Adaptive Control Systems ease the
computational burden in the robot controller, but are not as yet widely
available outside the laboratory. The development of sensors has usually
been at the expense of greater complexity at the end effector: this is the
antithesis of good nuclear design principles. Most immediately, the
required developments are:
e Improving the teleoperator image
- for successful human intervention and control.
e Force feedback to a master controller
- for critical operations.
e Design modularity
- to aid remote maintenance.
e Design for decontamination
- resistance to acid cleaning and water jetting.
e Standardization of interfaces
- so that common communications and software can be used.
e Robust viewing and sensing systems
- to allow adequate control.
-3-

Current analysis and hardware development under the Nuclear Robotics
Programme centre on five fundamental areas. In addition, complementary
work on indirect viewing®, power and communications, teleoperation and
posting, are features of the Active Handling Programme. The areas are:

e Communications, including multiplexing, to reduce cable handling

problems for remote manipulators.
e Servo characterization, for cranes, servomanipulators and robots.
e Robot enhancements and design upgrades for operation in radiation
environments.

e Radiation tolerance analysis, design and testing.

e Systems integration, to ensure compatibility.
A series of complementary test bed/demonstrator projects are being
constructed to establish the information needed to produce viable systems
for active plant. Because of the interaction of the enabling technologie
test rig evaluation, of for example, an IR controlled by a kinematically
dissimilar master arm, would incorporate features such as multiplexing and
human factors that will be investigated in their own right on other
equipment. Systems integration studies have helped to reduce interfacing
inconsistancies to a minimum.
COMMUNICATIONS
As in-cell equipment gets more complex, the burden on the communications
system increases. Multicored cables for cranes and gantry-mounted
manipulators are already meeting their limits in terms of reliability, ease
Of procurement, and maintainability. Outside the cell, however,
communications can follow non-nuclear practice closely. It is important to
make sure that the communications link is transparent to the individual and
grouped controllers. The choice of technique and media is strongly
dependent upon the partitioning between active and non-active plant areas.
The purpose of the research in this subject is to demonstrate compatibility

-4-

between different manufacturers! equipment and to link together a range of
test beds and systems to a central control station which, in some cases,
may be up to several hundred metres away.
The systems that eventually will be linked are:

® a gantry crane

e a transporter

e PUMA 560 and 761 robots

® remote viewing systems

® a customized Servoarm [a heavy duty, programmable, teleoperator]

e an electrically linked MSM,
and their systems integration is discussed below.
The emerging Manufacturing Automation Protocol [MAP] standards .may be
applied to in-cell mobile equipment. MAP benefits from worldwide
industrial backing and supports multi-channel video over the same link by
using a broadband technique on coaxial cable. However, remote handling
activities are unlikely to need all the facilities offered by the full MAP
standard. Networking is only required for multi-mode operation with
peer-to-peer communications. Mechanical handling will generally need to
use the Enhanced Performance Architecture [EPA] for real-time control.
Hardware is now available for broadband MAP, but EPA software has not yet
appeared in Europe. EPA would be used on carrier-band MAP [the so-called
mini-MAP], but this looses the advantage of a broadband medium. The system
media chosen for linking the test facilities is coaxial cable using
point-to-point modems, and will be used to carry multiple video, audio and
full duplex digital links.
SERVO CHARACTERIZATION
The overall aim of this part of the programme is to assess and demonstrate
the servo control techniques that are most suited to the wide range of
motion control tasks existing in current and future nuclear facilities.
Emphasis is placed on the application of present and emerging industrial
standards and developments, and on the use of industria] standard

-5 -

| components and equipment wherever possible. The phrase "servo
characterization" is used to include a number of allied areas within the
umbrella of servo control. These areas are:

e Mathematical modelling of servo components, including motors,
actuators, controllers and drive mechanisms.

e Modelling of drive transmissions, including non-linearities, loads
and disturbances, and their interaction and variability.

e Assessments of static and dynamic performance of servomanipulator
and crane servo systems’ motion in terms of a range of industrial
standard "performance indices".

e An understanding of the servo control techniques relevant to
obtaining guaranteed performance from equipment.

e Drive optimization and control system design.

. e Development of digital control systems.

e Test bed development for both model verification and demonstratia::
of control designs on representative hardware.

The two key application areas chosen for servo charactrerization studies
are bilateral servomanipulator drives and smooth crane control. The
bilateral servomanipulator test bed is being constructed around the master
and slave arm subassemblies of a commercially available manipulator. This
machine can manipulate 8kg and has a 1.5m reach; it was chosen because of
its impressive sense of feel and its reliability. Smooth crane control
has been demonstrated on a modified five tonne gantry crane which already
existed in a development laboratory. The original crane motors and
controllers were replaced with brushless AC servo systems, and remote
non-contacting position sensing and computer control has been installed.
The same crane has been used to demonstrate a robust short range
contactless communications system based on a specially developed capacitive
transducer. The transducer communicates with a coaxial cable laid along
the crane travel, and by segmenting the cable, fail-safe block exclusion
zones can be designed into the operating strategy.
-6-

The majority of commercially available force reflecting bilateral master
slave servomanipulators, developed for nuclear remote handling, use
mechanically backdrivable motor-gearbox combinations. This implies the use
of a motor with low coulombic friction and starting torque, low gear ratios
and transmission designs with considerable backlash, compliance and
effective wind-up. Conventional robotic transmissions require mechanically
non-backdrivable motions with high reduction gear ratios and low backlash,
to ensure repeatable and accurate position control. More recent
servomanipulator developments have applied electronic force sensing to
master and/or slave arms. to either supplement or replace the need for
mechanical backdrivability to generate a sense of feel. These solutions do
not attempt to match industrial standard component and assembly choices,
and are consequently expensive to implement. The test bed will use direct
force sensing and industrial standard drive systems to produce high quality
force reflection in robotic type joints. The electronically backdrivable
joints will have reverse force thresholds for sensitivities] that will at
least match the values obtained by the mechanical linkage or generated by
mechanically backdrivable techniques. |
Retrofitting motors and sensors onto the gantry crane will provide an
Opportunity to investigate a range of position sensing and control
strategies. Initial positioning uses two multipath distance infra-red
measurement systems which can be synchronized to produce co-ordinated
' motion in two degrees of freedom. The control system allows a selection of
preset velocity profiles on both major axes to generate, for example,
straight line vectored motion.
ROBOT ENHANCEMENTS
This part of the programme acknowledges that there are many remote handling
activities that would benefit from the option of using conventional IR
solutions. The radiation tolerance of IRs is low, but can be improved, and
real time man machine interfaces are being developed. The large installed
base of IRs worldwide means that there is an established infrastructure for
service and maintenance, provided any final system retains the majority of
attributes possessed by conventional robots. The approach taken is to
examine the components of an IR and provide a modification schedule for
items which are susceptible to radiation damage, with suggested radiation
-jJ-

: tolerant equivalents. Contamination control techniques are based on
master-slave manipulator experience. An initial design target of an
integrated dose of 106 rads had been set for the gradual introduction of
tolerant IRs.

The Unimation PUMA series of robots is being used to develop this
philosophy, partly because of the wealth of data available for the machines
from universities and research institutes. An experimental programme has
been devised to investigate a range of input devices such as joysticks,
trackballs, voice, position and force hand controllers. End effector based
sensors using force and vision as the contro] parameters are being looked
at [Figure 2].
It is anticipated that the major method of operating a radiation tolerant
robot would be through a workstation which contains all the relevant input
and feedback devices. A series of performance tests can be used to
validate the correct choice of panel layout, ease of control, ability to
perform certain tasks, and adequacy of remote viewing systems. These
benchmark tests can be varied to suit specific applications, and the test
facility itself is designed to allow a flexible selection of appropriat:
input/output devices, which are interfaced through an IBM PC-AT and a
broadband communications system, to the VAL II controller [Figure 3].
The notional functional requirements of a nuclear robot are:

e very high reliability [MTBF >5000 hrs]

® ease of in-celi service [MTTR <1 hour]

e long service interval [>1000 hours]

e radiation tolerance [>10® rad]

e use of industrial components

e industrially supported servicing

® ease of decontamination

e teleoperated and robotic operating modes

e ability to communicate with other plant.
The PUMA test facility also includes a two degrees of freedom transporter
which can support an inverted robot. Bulk motion control can be added into
the workstation to simulate an in-cell power manipulator equivalent. The
added mobility will help in applictions investigations which require gross
positioning of a manipulator and co-ordinated motion control.

RADIATION TOLERANCE
Radiation presents the most severe environmental hazard, especially in fuel
reprocessing facilities. Here, and during decontamination, the robot might
also be heavily exposed to aggressive fluids. Dose rate is particularly
difficult to specify accurately in a large facility, as overall beta/gamma
activity may vary by about eight orders of magnitude. Those facilities
which are concerned with alpha activity generally have low dose rates and
total dosages, but require the robot to be designed to avoid contamination
carry-over and to be easily decontaminated. The small sizes of laboratory
glove boxes may often preclude efficient utilization of robots if retro-
fitted. As with the design of an Advanced Manufacturing Technology cell,
the robot should be included as an integral part of the handling machinery,
rather than as an add-on extra.
Every component of a robot should be examined to assess its radiation
tolerance. A value of 104 rads is approximately correct for the total
survivable dose of an unaltered IR, although the actual degradation might
be gradual. Critical items would be:

® encoders Cor other transducers]

® any electronics

¢ organic material

e cable and connector insulation

e seals

e gaitering

¢ lubricants
Radiation testing allows estimates to be made for these critical items. A
comprehesive data base does not exist for all these components, but would
be necessary if widespread application of robots in the high radiation
environment was envisaged. Data from space, military and accelerator
sources is often not relevant because either the irradiation levels or
energy spectra are different, or the dose rates do not match those expected
in nuclear facilities. Fortunately, robot manufacturers have tended to
modularize their products so that it is relatively easy to replace, for

-9-

example, a motor-gearbox-brake-encoder package as a unit. This means that
for the supercritical components a replacement-when-degraded strategy may
give up to an order of magnitude mitigation against the total dose limit
for the robot.
The radiation tolerance of most important industrial standard electronic
components falls as successive component generations achieve higher levels
of integration, with semiconductor techniques that appear increasingly
susceptible to radiation damage. To compound this problem, these
components .are being incorporated into existing types of equipment that
used to be free from such sophistication. Pressures for increased
complexity of plant design naturally look for added complexity in
electronics-based equipment, much of which is destined for in-cell use.
Unfortunately, the nuclear power industry has such a spectrum of radiation
, environments that unique solutions do not exist to radiation damage, and

particular cases have to be examined in their own right. .
Figure 4 shows an example of radiation tolerant electronics design. The
split head camera electronics contains the minimum of electronics and has
no 'presets' or adjustments: it is essentially maintenance free during its
irradiated lifetime. The electronics can tolerate 109 rad of gamma
radiation with only minor deterioration to horizontal picture resolution
[700 TV lines reduced to 650 TV lines]. Dose rates of up to 106 rad per
hour are possible without significant loss of picture quality.
SYSTEM INTEGRATION
System integration features as part of the programme because of the
potentially strong interactions between the development hardware, which
needs to be effectively cross-linked. To integrate these separate items of
development hardware and to avoid repetition of common tasks, guidelines
have been defined for:

® computer hardware
e software .

e interfaces

e documentation

e software Quality Assurance Plan

~ - 10 -

It is also essential to identify all possible future upgrades so that the
system architecture can be structured to absorb them at a later date if
necessary.
As indicated, the IBM-PC AT has been selected as the standard control hard-
ware because of its good price/performance index. It also has the ability
to incorporate high speed array processor boards for tasks which are
computationally intensive. There are a significant number of software
modules which will be common to most, if not all, of the control systems.
These will be written with sufficient generality to satisfy all
applications. This approach may introduce a smal] time overhead but it
should reduce software costs significantly. Long term reliability will be
improved because of the additional exercise received by the module from
running on more than one system,
The complete system will consist of five IBM PC-ATs, all operating as real-
time controllers, with each PC running under the real-time operating system
MTOS. For a system of such complexity the use of a design methodology for
the software analysis and design phases of the software life cycle is
essential. To satisfy this requirement, Yourdon's real-time structure
techniques are applied with the aid of the appropriate software tools’.
As already indicated, for part of the initial robot development programme
the PUMA robots and their controllers will interact directly or indirectly
with their immediate environment consisting of:

® a transporter which provides two additional degrees of freedom

® a stereo TV remote viewing system

© a man-machine interface which includes joysticks, master arm,

stereo monitor and VDU.
In addition the future developments will require the PUMA arms to function
in close co-operation with an overhead crane and the electrically linked
master-slave manipulator. All of these devices will operate remotely from
their control consoles. Communication between the control room and the
simulated active application area will be via a frequency division
multiplexed link. The physical medium, a broadband co-axial cable, permits
a future upgrade to a MAP system.
-ji-

These systems will all work in relatively close proximity to their
controllers. To assess the performance of a system operating remotely at a
distance of 100m the communication link has been extended to another
building. Here a Harwell] customized 3 degrees of freedom, hydraulic arm
with a lifting capacity of 300kg at 3 metres, Servoarm, will perform tasks
as instructed from the remote control room. Two mono CCTV cameras will
provide remote viewing.
CONCLUSION
The Harwell Nuclear Robotics Programme has begun to adapt industrial
robotics practice to the nuclear environment. The limitations of off-the-
shelf IRs are being evaluated, and improvements in the subsystems are being
developed to allow a greater penetration of these manipulators into the
nuclear industry. The use of standards in procurement which match
available industrial equipment will ensure a continuity of supply, thereby
reducing the cost of producing small batches of future "nuclear robotic"
manipulators. Methods of communication, both jin choice of protocol and
hardware realization are being investigated to relieve some of the serious
constraints posed by the multicore cable which invariably connects the
manipulator to the outside world. A variety of test bed evaluations and
demonstrator mock-ups are being built to ensure that subsystems can be
effectively combined to produce integrated telerobotic active handling
' systems.
