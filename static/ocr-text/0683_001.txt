As a less costly altermative to the use of a superconducting coil

in the experimental testing of the split-track maglev system for

high spead transport, pulse-operated copper coils, cooled with

liquid nitrogen, have been successfully used for the force measure- .

Ments. Calculations have been carried out for constant current

conditions to establish the conductor specific heat, resistance

and voltage time relationships during the pulse, together with an

experimental investigation of coil heat transfer in restricted open

pool boiling. The result has been an increased sensitivity and :

the ability to examine a variety of configurations at a reduced :

cost.
INTRODUCTION
For small scale levitation experiments based on the electrodynamic principle, super-
conducting magnets with their relatively small power supplies have been used for ext-
ended running and, at Warwick, tests have been carried out with a superconducting .
coil mounted in a force balance above a 3-m diameter test wheel, operating up to
45 m/s. However, it was found that the superconducting coil with its mechanical
supports within the helium cryostat and vacuum assembly tended to make design changes
relatively expensive and experimentally difficult, For prototype design configur-

ese ations, therefore, it would be advantageous to use conventional copper coils to invest~

igate the effect of coil shapes on the strength and distribution of the forces gener-
ated. This would enable an optimised coil geometry to be developed as the initial
stage before constructing the superconducting coil, .
The design of the coils requires a minimal cross-section conductor area in order to
model the geometric relationship with the superconducting equivalent. To match the
constant flux condition of the superconducting coil the high current density is acco-
mmodated by pulse operation of the coils under constant current excitation. More
normal operation of pulse coils is with a constant voltage and so a previous analysis
is re-examined for constant current conditions. The calculations establish the con-
ductor specific heat, resistance and voltage time relationships during the pulse and
these are supplemented with an experimental investigation of coil heat transfer in .
restricted openpool boiling, This investigation. has allowed pulse-operated copper.
coils with a liquid nitrogen cryogen to be used as an alternative to superconducting
coils over the 3-metre test wheel, Levitation force measure ments have established
parameter dependence for the split-track system and the results compare with predict-
10ns.
In the following analysis the voltage and temperature rise in a cryogenically-cooled
copper coil, pulsed with uniform current density, are established (the ampere-turns
are kept constant under current control),

ANALYSIS. FOR PRECOOLED COILS ‘
The analysis has been carried out on the basis that the resistivity of the copper coil
is reduced by a factor of 8 at the temperature of liquid nitrogen. Likewise, the
‘ specific heat, c_ , is also temperature dependent. The fundamental equations govern-
; ing the current Bad temperature rise in a uniform current density, pulsed coil are
given by,
v(t) = L di(t)/de + i(t)(Re + R(t)) . (1)
and 2
. ar(e) /de = i”(e)R(t) /ye, (¢) (2)
where v(t), i(t), R(t) are the terminal voltage, coil current and coil resistance
at time t, respectively, and L = coil inductance, Re = extemal (current lead)
resistance, y = conductor density (kg/m3), V = conductor volume (m3), ¢ (t) =
conductor specific heat (J/kgk), and T(t) = conductor temperature (K). P If we assume
that both v(t) and T(t) can be represented by a power series expansion [1] then
equations (1) and (2) can be satisfied for all the coefficients sequentially, thus

and since the current will be kept constant, then di(t)/dt = 0 and i(t) = I so that ata
(1) becomes
v(t) = 1(R, + R(t)) (4)
The way that the coil resistance R(t) and R(t)/c (ct) varies with time is not known, ;
but can be deduced. from the temperature at time E by the relationships:
R(t) = R[l + (T(t) - 7] (5)

Substituting (3), (8), (9) and (10) into (4) and (2) and equating coefficients, it

. So, if equation (11) is normalised by the coil time constant, then by substituting .
(12) and, by using the Maclaurin expansion for ePXt to give a closed solution, it
can be shown that

CONCLUSIONS |
This investigation has shown that pulse-operated copper coils with liquid nitrogen
cooling can be used as a cheaper and more versatile alternative to superconducting
coils for scaled experiments. It is also suggested from this work that copper or . |
aluminium coils with liquid nitrogen, pool boiling could provide an acceptable and
cost effective alternative to superconductors for the field coils of a linear :
synchronous motor drive for a wheeled suspension, transport system, |
