EXTENSION TO PATENT APPLICATION 8204120
— AN ELECTRIC POWER TRANSFER SYSTEM —
MULTI-DEGREE-OF-FREEDOM POWER TRANSFER
Introduction
The original application suggested essentially one degree-of~freedom
(1DOF) power transfer whereby the motion considered would be along the locus of
a line which could be straight, curved or circular. The arrangement was most
favourable when moving core portions provided wiping contact with stationary
core portions, so that both could be simply supported without interference of
structural or re-entrant elements, which restrict motion. There is no inherent
reason why the moving surfaces need be constrained to IDOF motion, and so
simple two and three DOF structures could also be built. Simple structures
would tend to have limited ranges of motion, but it is possible to provide, for
example, a spherical arrangement giving 2DOF where one is continuous. Many
other combinations exist.
Basic Concept
Figure 1 illustrates the basic concept. A moveable core with secondary
winding is part of a magnetic circuit which sige Comes a back core, primary
winding and extended pole-face (magnetic cross sections are shown to be square,
but they could equally be circular). The mating surfaces can be aligned to
provide a uniform mechanical clearance, which for spherical motion demands
convex and concave surfaces. Orthogonal motion of course requires only flat
surfaces. A return path from the back core to the lower part of the moveable
core is assumed.

Implementation

Figure 2 shows one form of a single phase 2DOF system. The system is
electrically and mechanically bidirectional, that is, either side of the air
gap can be made the primary or the secondary; it is likely that the more
massive structure will be the primary, stationary member. Because of the
multidimensional construction of the magnetic circuit, ferrite powder would be
a suitable material choice. The primary yoke could have its perimeter either
circular or made up of four chords, with the inner core being circular or
square respectively. To restrict motion to favourable magnetic circuits, the
yoke perimeter would probably incorporate a crash bar. A single circular ring
joins top and bottom yokes to return flux. Alternatively the return path could
be c-shaped to allow access to more of the inner core.

If the yoke is formed inté a loop, then a single phase 3DOF structure
with continuous roll and limited pitch and yaw is developed, Figure 3. A three
phase structure with limited roll pitch and yaw is shown in Figure 4,

Combinations can be ganged up to provide polyphase versions, with the
return flux ring positioned as appropriate.
