For high speed ground transport, magnetic levitation, using
repulsion between moving high field (superconducting) magnets and an
electrically conducting guideway may be considered. ‘The same magnets
may be the field windings of a linear synchronous motor for propulsion.
The nature of the magnetic and other forces acting on the vehicle
are discussed. For acceptable ride characteristics additional damping
is needed, probably provided by an active control system.
The Wolfson sponsored project to build a demonstration maglev
vehicle at the University of Warwick is described.

MAGLEV VEHICLE OSCILLATIONS AND DAMPING MECHANISMS

R. G. Rhodes, B. E. Mulhall, E. Abel*

introduction

The possibility of overcoming wheel friction, wear and vibration by
contactless suspensions for high speed vehicles is being investigated

at a number of centres throughout the world. Both the air cushion or
hovercraft principle and levitation by magnetic forces are being actively :
developed for future ground transport systems. Of the several magnetic
suspensions proposed, utilizing either attraction or repulsion between
magnetic poles, the one involving the repulsion force generated between
Superconducting magnets mounted on the vehicle and an electrically-
conducting aluminium guideway is being examined at the University of
Warwick supported by the Wolfson Foundation.

This method of levitation, generally referred to as 'maglev', has the
desirable feature of being inherently stable in contrast to the alternative
'attraction' system which requires a control loop for its stability.
Magnetic Levitation

The basic principles of the maglev system are fairly simple and reasonably
well understood and the applications to vehicle suspension and guidances
have been exhaustively studied and described by a number of authors.!?2?3?4
In brief, the relative movement of the d.c. vehicle magnets induces eddy
currents to flow in the surface layers of a conducting sheet (or loop)
guideway. These transient currents circulate in such a direction to
produce repulsive lift forces. The force increases rapidly with speed
and in the high speed limit it is equal to the 'image' magnet force, i.e.
an imaginary magnet replacing the conducting sheet, carrying an equal and
opposite current to the real magnet and situated the same distance below
the guideway as the vehicle magnet is above it. In practice the lift
force approaches its upper limit at a vehicle speed which depends on the
magnet coil dimensions (the length to width ratio of rectangular coils)
and the thickness of the aluminium guideway, but is typically a few tens
of km/hr. However, the eddy currents flowing in an aluminium guideway of
finite conductivity dissipate a certain amount of power in the forn of
Joule losses which appear as a drag force on the vehicle magnets. ‘This
drag force passes through a peak value at low speeds of a few km/hr and
then decreases continuously with speed approximately as 1/v?.

To achieve the levitation forces that would be consistent with levitation
heights of 200 - 300 mm which are considered desirable for high speed
ground systems, very large currents are needed in the vehicle magnets.
These can only be provided economically by the use of superconductors and
the superconducting magnet, having virtually zero resistance, consumes no
power in operation other than the small amount necessary to keep it a low
temperature (4.2K). With a vehicle-track clearance of this magnitude the
ride quality should be relatively independent of the surface smoothness
and irregularities in the guideway.

The propulsion of a levitated vehicle by methods similar to aircraft would
be quite unacceptable at ground level for obvious environmental reasons.
Linear electric’ mtors would appear to offer the best solution, therefore,
and both the induction and the synchronous types are being considered for
this purpose. However, partly because of its weight, and partly on account
of the stringent requirement for a small gap (approximately 1 em) between
the stator winding on the vehicle and the reaction rail on the track of
the induction motor propulsion this type would probably not be compatible
with the large-gap of the maglev suspension. The linear synchronous motor,
on the other hand, can still operate at reasonably efficiency with air
gaps if several centimeters and with the very high d.c. fields provided
by the superconducting coils on the vehicle, it is natural to consider
propulsion by this type of motor, the armature winding being laid out along
the track. With this arrangement of powered track a variable frequency
supply is necessary for acceleration and deceleration of the vehicle. To
provide for this an alternative system, being investigated at Warwick, is
to switch the track winding in a manner analogous to the commutator in a
d.c. machine; the switch, however, would be remotely operated by solid
state SCR devices and a three-phase power supply would be used.
The Wolfson Project
With a grant from the Wolfson Foundation a small team has recently beer:
set up to both demonstrate the feasibility and to test the performance of
a magnetically levitated vehicle model with the object of high-lighting
those engineering problems to which a full-scale revenue vehicle may be
subjected.
A straight and level track of approximately 600 m in length and 1 meter in
width, allowing test speeds up to 250 km/hr, will be constructed on tne
University campus. A vehicle 3 m by 1 m and weighing 500 kg is being
designed with accommodation for two passengers. For levitation and
guidance the vehicle will carry two or more superconducting coils
approximately 0.8 m square with a field of 7 x 10* A-turns, providing 4
net vehicle-track clearance of about 100 mm.
Some of the major elements of hardware, in particular the concrete track
structures and aluminium guideway, terminal facilities, and vehicle body,
cryostat and superconducting coils, are being designed.
The design is such as to permit maximum flexibility in the configuration
of the levitation, guidance and propulsion elements, since parallel
theoretical and laboratory studies of these are still ina pre lirinary
stage. A major part of the design study, and testing of the vehicle,
will be devoted to the dynamic behaviour with a view to determining how
far the natural characteristics of the levitation will need modifying,
either by passive or by active control. At this stage it is already
possible to state the problem in broad terms and identify particular
areas.
Vehicle Constraints
The steady, or slowly-varying forces on the vehicle are its weight, aero-
dynamic drag (including the sideways component due to crosswinds), magnetic
lift, guidance and drag forces from the guideway, and electromagnetic '
thrust (and in general also vertical and sideways forces) from the propul-
sion system. Although there is inherent stability in the vertical direct-
jon it is not obvious a priori that the same is true of other modes e.g. ,
roll, or indeed that sustained oscillations cannot develop from the

linear motor propulsion. It is already known that the magnetic forces are

associated with very little damping, and hence even in a stable mode any

disturbance may be expected to produce oscillations only decaying over

many cycles.

The object, nevertheless, is to provide a ride of sufficient smoothness to

be not only acceptable from the point of view of passenger comfort, but

also to be better than present day ground transport systems, and ideally

even better than modern aircraft can provide. The question of acceptable

standards is considered extensively elsewhere 5; our purpose is to
investigate what is required of the system design to meet them. The main

sources of disturbance will include :

a) aerodynamic, from wind gusts, passing vehicles, nearby structures and

the like.

b) aerodynamic oscillatory forces arising from vortex shedding in a steady
wind flow over nearby structures or over the vehicle itself 6,

c) track roughness and undulations

d) the periodic structure of the track windings, where these are used for
levitation in place of a continuous sheet or where certain types of Linear
motor, such as the linear cormutator motor, are used, giving rise to
oscillatory disturbances.

e) acceleration and deceleration, or centrifugal forces.

Because of the large gap and consequent relatively low compliance of the
magnetic forces the motion is on the one hand less sensitive to traci
roughness, and on the other more sensitive to other disturbances, than
the much stiffer suspensions of traditional transport systems.

Magnetic Forces

The magnetic forces are best understood, in the sense that they are
completely prescribed by the system design. Moreover, given a fairly
simple system the lift and guidance forces can easily be computed in tne
nigh speed limit (they are just the forces between the vehicle magnet and
its images). In more complicated geometries the high speed limit forces
can be deduced from inductance measurements on scale models, provided that
the measuring frequency is high enough for the 'skin effect! in the model
to be well developed.

Three different guideway patterns are being seriously considered, as
sketched in Figs. 1. In Fig. l(a) lift and guidance are produced by tne
horizontal and vertical surfaces respectively, and in general mocions
along the two axes are decoupled. However, the presence of the vertical
members is expensive of track material, is physically restricting (thougn
this may be advantageous in case the magnetic system should fail), and
has increased drag on account of the extra image magnets created.
Somewhat less restrictive physically, and with the ability to shed deoris,
is a V or inverted V track. A variant of the V is the semicircular tracé
of Kolm and Thornton +, which is claimed to allow the vehicle to roll to
the correct angle of bank on bends. Unfortunately it may be shown !?*
that the coupling of roll and sway gives rise to instability in most
practical situations (suspension from an overhead track is an exception).
Means to overcome this, for example, by providing additional perpendicular
surfaces (Reitz 5 et al) or by a magnetic 'keel' (Thornton 4), have been
proposed.

From the point of view of track costs, visual acceptability, ease of
switching, freedom from the accumulation of debris, and compatability
with other vehicles, the scheme of Fig. (e) is interesting. The lift is
reduced relative to scheme (a), thus requiring perhaps 50% more super~
conductor, but this is more than offset by the savings in aluminium.
Typical lift and guidance behaviour is sketched in Fig. 2; this does not
however show the couples generated in roll, and the conditions for vehicle
stability have not as yet been deduced.
Other Forces
A considerable amount of data is available on aerodynamic forces on venicles,
some of which is summarised by Reitz et al ’. The most significant point
is that, for typical revenue vehicles, the magnetic forces dominate. “le
same authors also present an extensive discussion of the characterisation
of guideway roughness,
Analysis of Motion
Given quantitative data on the forces discussed in the preceding section,

analysis of the motion of a magnetically levitated vehicle is in principle

relatively straight forward. Indeed, since aerodynamic forces in general
appear to be small, it should be possible to derive the response (transfer
function) of the vehicle from a knowledge of the magnetic forces alone;
the disturbing forces are then an input to which we wish to make the
system insensitive.
Difficulties arise because the equations in fact are highly non-linear,
and because all possible modes of motion may be present equally and will
in general be more or less strongly coupled. ‘Thus, although analyses of
vehicle behaviour have been published ®, they are restricted in that the
equations are linearised (and hence are only appropriate to small oscilla-
tions about equilibrium), and some degree of decoupling has been assuned .
so that only two or three modes are considered simultaneously. To 4
large extent the linear approximation is of interest, since the limt of
validity appears to be of the same order (vibration amplitudes of a few
millimetres) as the limit of acceptable ride quality. Nevertheless, it
will also be necessary to demonstrate that motions of the largest amplitude
that could arise infact represent a safe situation.
How far the assumptions of decoupling are valid is not a present clear.
It has already been demonstrated that with the most economical guideways
there is strong coupling between modes.
A similar situation arises where a linear electric machine is used for
propulsion, since as well as thrust there will be vertical forces, and
also lateral forces if the vehicle winding is displaced laterally relative
to the track winding; moreover these forces are similar in magnitude to
those produced by the magnetic levitation schemes described. The natural
conclusion is that in the interest of efficiency and econory the levitation
and propulsion should be designed to aid, rather than oppose each other.
Unfortunately we have not, at the time of writing, sufficient results to
show dynamic stability.
Methods of Control
The work of the Stanford ® and Ford ° groups has shown that the natural
damping of magnetically levitated systems is insufficient for vassenger
comfort. Damping can be added by means of short-circuited coils situated

2)
between the levitation magnets and the track, though for best performance
these should be cooled, to reduce their electrical resistivity (typically
to 80 ~ 100°K). With this passive damping, however, it is difficult to
damp out the fundamental vehicle frequency of approximately lHz, fixed
essentially by the large suspension height. Reitz et al ° propose a
secondary suspension, but suggest it would be difficult to produce satis-
factorily as its own natural frequency should be 0.4 Hz or less.

The general conclusion is that for acceptable ride quality, some form of
active control is required. The problems of active control centre on the
choice of output device for the control system and three possibilities have
been considered:

(1) the levitation coils themselves

(2) auxiliary coils, which may replace the passive damping coils

(4) aerofoil surfaces

Tne last method has been discussed, for control of vertical oscillations

by Reitz et al 7, who found that the simple flaps considered were too

large in area to be readily acceptable. ‘Thus, although this work is not
definitive, the prospects for this type of control are not good.

Both the Ford and Stanford groups have discussed electrical contrcl systems,
and find that the control power needed for typical guideway roughness is
rather modest. However, figures are not quoted for smoothing out the
effects of strong wind gusts; since the force produced by a 100 kph gust

2s likely to be several times that of guideway undulations of 10 mm or so,
the total control power required might be increased by an order of.
magnitude. Under these circumstances it will be preferable to use
auxiliary control coils rather than the levitation coils themselves, for
two main reasons :

(1) the power losses in the superconductor, when subject to the control
current fluctuations, would prove unacceptably large.

(2) by placing the control coil nearer the track than the main coil (it
would typically be on one of the cryostat vessels forming the thermal
insulation for the superconducting coil) less reactive power would be
needed.

The design of such a system is included in the Wolfson Project.

Conclusion

The problems of designing a magnetically levitated vehicle to afford good
riding qualities have been outlined. It is concluded that a satisfactory
system will incorporate auxiliary coils in the cryostat, probably as part
of an active control system.

The Wolfson project at the University of Warwick, directed specifically to
prodee a demonstration and test vehicle has been described. A vehicle is
being designed, and calculations and model tests to establish the stability
of the guideway illustrated in Fig. le are being undertaken. Propulsion
of the model by a linear synchronous or commutator motor is being considered;
initial theoretical and model studies of the motor are in hand, to be
followed by an analysis of its effect on the vehicle's dynamic behaviour.
