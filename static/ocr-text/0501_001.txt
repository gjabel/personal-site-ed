REMOTE TECHNOLOGY
A NEATER advance in active handling
By E. Abel and C. J. H. Watson
The NEATER robot, commercially launched in December 1989 by AEA Technology and
Staubli Unimation, arose from the recognition that technological advances in the
non-nuclear robotics industry were beginning to outstrip those in the nuclear active
handling sector.
