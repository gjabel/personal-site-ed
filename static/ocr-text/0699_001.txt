Display brightness and contrast, ambient lighting an¢é
viewina distance are constrained by practical considerations. A
@isplay must be bright enough and have enough contrast to he
intellicible; ambient lighting must be bright enough to allow °*
concurrent tasks, such as paperwork or working the controls of e
machine. Viewing distance should not be increased beyonce that fror
which an observer cannot resolve the detail in the displey.

The flicker generated can be minimised by the desicn of
the display:-

-A lone persistence phosphor will reduce flicker, but
will also cause blurring of moving pictures. Fcr
many applications this may be unacceptable.

-Interlace is best avoided for field rates around 50F2z,
particularly where short viewing distances are
unevoiaabile.

-TIt is possible to build displays to operate at fieic
rates creeter than 50Hz. These are a good solution fe.
computer displavs, but present a problem for
television systens; the entire system must operate at
the higher field@ rate an@ will thus be incompatih ce
with existing equipment. Ancillaries workina et
increased field rates are likely to be costly.

-In the near future it will be possible to display
viegeo signals from conventional television equipment
on hich scan rete monitors by employing digital sicnai
processing. However, to be really effective scar.
conversions must be motion adaptive ana at the
nonent this is not a trivial problem.

There ig some evidence to succest that the humen visual
syster responds to intermittent illumination at frequencies above
flicker fusion. However an experiment by the authors found no major
Gifferences in an observers performance of a visual search task at
three Gifferent field rates; 50, 80 and l100Hz.

No conclusive evidence has demonstrated that flicker
causes eyestrain or has any long term, adverse effects on health,
although most people would agree flickerino displays are unpleasant
to work with.

1.0 Introduction.

It is well known that the image displayed on a cathode
ray tube (CRT) is generated by bombarding a phosphor coatec screen
with an electron beam. In response, the phosphor emits light and, so
that the whole screen can be addressed, the electron beam is made to
scan. The light emitted by the phosphor decays rapidly and
exponentially once the beam has passed, but if the rate of scanning is
high enough the whole screen will appear to be equally illuminated.
This is a property of the human visual system, not of the display
{unless the phosphor is of exceptionally long persistence) and is
commonly called the persistence of vision. The process is largely
equivalent to a low-pass filtering in the temporal domain, but like
all things human, the filter characteristics are somewhat variable,
and dependent on many factors.

A linear scanning system can be defined in terms of
L/f£/i:1 where L=the number of lines scanned, f=the the fielc rate and
1= the interlace factor. European television systems (PAL end SECAM)
scan a frame of 625 lines, and each line is refreshed 25 times per
second. In the USA (NTSC) 525 lines are scanned 30 times per second.
To improve the effective refresh rate a 2:1 interlace is used whereby
each frame is divided into two fields. One field contains ell the odd
numbered lines, the other all the even numbered lines. These are then
scanned alternately so that one of an adjacent pair of lines is
refreshed every 50th, or in the USA 60th of a second. If the screen is
viewed from a distance at which it is not possible to see the
individual lines, then the whole screen appears to be refreshed f
times a second whilst the actual refresh rate is f/i. Thus PAL and
SECAM use a 625/50/2:1 scanning system while NTSC uses 525/60/2:1.

It is quite clear both from experience and the vast
range of psychophysical data available that television displays using
these standards will appear to flicker under a variety of viewing
conditions. The flicker is usually made up from three components;
Large, bright areas will flicker at the field rate; if the line
structure is visible, a patterned flicker at the frame rate, known as
interline flicker, will be evident, and picture detail which excites
only a single scan line will flicker at the frame rate. (Although
Strictly speaking, the second of these is best described as jitter
rather than flicker.) Many people find this annoying, and sometimes
extremely disturbing. If television is used intensively for remote
viewing the annoyance could be considerable and excessive flicker may,
in addition, have more serious effects.

The first section of this report reviews the factors
which affect the perception of flicker, and how these may be used to
optimise viewing conditions. The second section looks at other ways of
reducing flicker and the third discusses whether flicker has any
adverse effects on health or visual performance.

1.1 Factors Affecting The Perception of Flicker.
From the enormous number of psychophysical experiments
on flicker, it is evident that there are a large number of variables
and that the details of the experimental design are fairly critical to
; the outcome. Therefore a detailed summary is difficult.

Many results cannot be applied to television displays
in a quantitative way; traditional flicker studies have used uniform
fields and sinusoidal or squarewave modulation, sometimes at very low
levels, whereas the flicker in television pictures is spatially and
temporally complex, usually at high levels of modulation. However it
is likely that the results can be applied in a qualitative way.

If the human visual system is considered as a temporal,
low-pass filter, then flicker sensitivity could be characterized by
plotting the filter’s modulation transfer function. For an electronic
or mechanical filter this would normally be done by measuring the
output for a given input, but in the case of the human filter it is
not possible to measure the filter output directly. Hence, the input
required for a constant output is measured; if the filter has a linear
amplitude response this is entirely equivalent. The level of constant
output is the threshold for which a flickering source first appears to
be steady. The frequency for a particular depth of modulation at which
this point is reached is called the Critical Fusion Frequency (CFF).

Figure 1 shows three typical response curves at
Gifferent retinal illuminances, determined by de Lange (1958), after
whom such curves are commonly known. However, since the linearity of
the human filter is questionable, such curves can only loosely be
Gescribed as the response curves of the filter.

The unit of retinal illumination, the Troland, is the
product of field luminance in cd/sq m and pupil area in sq mm. The
curves in figure 1 are, in fact, for a complex waveform, so
modulations of up to 200% are possible. Generally, CFF ranges from a
few HZ up to around 90 Hz.

The main factors found to affect CFF are (mostly from
Brown 1965):-

a) Field size.

There is a linear relationship between CFF and the log
of field size for a wide range of luminance levels; CFF increases
with the visual angle subtended, This is often known as the Granit-
Harper law and has been verified for fields of up to 50 degrees of
visual angle and centred at retinal locations up to 10 deg away from
the fovea.

The visual angle subtended by a display monitor depends
on the viewing distance and the size of the monitor. A monitor of
diagonal d, viewed from a distance of v will subtend an angle of:-

2 Arctan (d/2v) degrees
5

e.g an industry standard, 46cm (19 inch) monitor viewed
from 1.2m will subtend an angle of 22 degrees.

b) Field luminance.

Over the range for which the Granit-Harper law .
operates, CFF increases linearly with the log of retinal
illumination. Figure 2 shows this for fields of 6 and 19 degrees,
fixated centrally. 10 Hz for each tenfold increase luminance is fairly
typical. This is sometimes known as the Ferry-Porter law.

At high retinal illuminance the curve flattens out.
In figure 2 this happens at about 3200 Trolands. If the pupil diameter
of the eye is taken to vary between 2mm and 8mm, this would correspond
to a screen luminance of between 16 and 256 cd/sq m. Pupil diameter is
determined by a number of factors other than the amount of incident
light. It is therefore not clear whether the upper limit, above which
field luminance will have little effect on CFF, lies within the range
of screen jluminances commonly found in TV displays, where maximum
white level is typically in the range 60-150cd/sq m.

At low luminances a second branch to the curve
Gevelops. This is assumed to be where only rod photo-receptor cells
are stimulated and is outside the luminance range likely to be
encountered in television displays.

At flicker frequencies above fusion the perceived
brightness is proportional to the time averaged luminance of the
flickering field. This is the Talbot-Plateau law and the implication
for television is that CRTs with short persistence phosphors have to
produce much higher peak luminances than long persistence tubes to
achieve the same apparent brightness.

c) Retinal location.

For small sized fields CFF decreases with increasing
aistance from the fovea, but for larger fields (Granit and Harper
suggest >2 degrees ) the reverse is true and CFF tends to be higher in
peripheral vision. The latter case is applicable to CRT displays.

For this reason, flicker is likely to be more of a
problem for a bank of display monitors, where there will inevitably be
one or more monitors in the field of peripheral vision. In such cases
it is preferable to have the monitor scans synchronised to eliminate
the possibility of beat frequencies becoming noticeable,

Similarly, for a monitor which subtends a large visual
angle (say >30 degrees), the corners will be well into peripheral
vision and may flicker even though the centre of the screen appears
steady. Likewise, the centre of the picture may flicker when the
extremes are viewed; the flicker will move around in the opposite
Girection to area of interest.

6

ad) Adapted state of the eye

As the eye becomes more light adapted (i.e. adapted to
brighter light) then CFF increases. Therefore ambient lighting and the
nature of the immediate surrounding field become important. However
when the display subtends a large visual angle then the luminance of
the display is probably the most important factor in determining the
adapted state.

e) Age

Like most aspects of human performance, CFF declines
with age; older persons are less sensitive to flicker.

f) The mark:space ratio of the flicker

A decrease in mark:space ratio will lead to a decrease
in the perceived brightness. If the average luminance is held
constant then CFF increases very nearly in proportion to the loa of
the relative duration of the dark interval. This is entirely
consistent with the considerations in the next paragraph.

g) The flicker waveform.

CFF depends on the amplitude of the fundamental Fourier
component of a complex waveform if the first and higher harmonics are
outside the pass-band of the human visual system filter or at least

. highly attenuated (de Lange 1958 ). This is likely to be the case for
television where the fundamental is not lower than 25Hz.

However the amplitude of the fundamental can be very
Gifferent from the waveform’s peak to peak amplitude. For a€ square
wave the fundamental is 1.27 times the peak to peak amplitude, and
for the waveform of a CRT with a short persistence phosphor, the
fundamental can be as high as twice the peak to peak amplitude of the
complex waveform, and thus should have a higher CFF than a sinusoidal
waveform of the same frequency and peak to peak amplitude.

h) Spatial frequency

The human visual system does not process spatial ance
temporal information entirely separately; an image stabilised on the
retina with respect to eye movement will rapidly appear to fade, but
under intermittent illumination the visual sensation remains.
(Ditchburn et al 1959)

Robson (1966) has measured the variation of temporal
modulation sensitivity with spatial frequency and its complement, the
variation of spatial modulation sensitivity (i.e the ability to
distinguish a grating from a uniform field) with temporal frequency.
Figures 3 illustrates this, replotting from Robson’s data, modulation
sensitivity as a function of both spatial and temporal frequency.

7

Similarly, Graham and Landis (1959) have demonstrated a
relationship between CFF and spatial frequency, for Sinewave gratings
with squarewave temporal modulation. CFF exhibits a minimum when
plotted against spatial frequency and is depressed by about 10HZ for a
spatial frequency of 7.1 cycles per degree, relative to a field
without striations. Thereafter CFF rises to slightly above its initial
value as spatial frequency is increased to 20 cpd.

Quantitatively, Robson’s results, using a field of only
2.5 by 2.5 degrees and modulation considerably less than 100%, are of
dubious applicability to television displays. Similarly, but to a
lesser extent those of Graham and Landis, but the existance of such a
spatio-temporal interaction may explain the common observation that an
interlaced picture has subjectively less vertical resolution than a
non-interlaced one with the same number of lines. It has been
suggested that at a field rate of 50HzZ resolution is reduced by a
factor of 0.8, at 60 Hz the factor is 0.87, and is 0.95 for 75Hz.

1.2 The Effects of Line Interlacing on Flicker

The idea behind line interlacing is to enabie the
transmission of a larger number of lines for a given bandwidth and
flicker than would be possible with a sequential scan. For instance,
625 lines scanned as 625/25/1:1 would flicker considerably more than
625/50/2:1 but use no less bandwidth. However, interlace has’ the
conseguences that picture detail which excites only sincle TV line
will flicker at half the field rate, that bright areas of the picture
will exhibit a patterned flicker and horizontal edges will hop up and
down, again at half the field rate.

White (1978) showed that subjectively there is @ rapid
diminution of picture quality once the interlaced line structure
becomes visible. He has also pointed out, that from the often
recommended viewing distance of 6 times the picture height, a person
with 6/6 or better visual acuity should be able to resolve the line
Structure of a@ 625 line display.

In addition, it is our opinion that an interlaced
display viewed peripherally flickers more than the equivalent
sequentially scanned display; here the line structure cannot’ be
resolved, but perhaps there is a greater spatio-temporal interaction
than for foveal vision. This, together with the observation in the
previous section, that the improvement in resolution afforded by
interlacing is not as large as expected, suggests that all in all the
benefits of line interlacing at 50 or 60HZ are minimal.

1.3 The Prediction of Flicker Thresholds for a CRT from a
Modulated Homogeneous Field

a)Van der Zee, Roufs and van der Meulen

An experiment by van der Zee, Roufs and van der Meulen
(1983) explicitly compared flicker thresholds for a modulated
homogeneous field with those for a CRT display. The aim was to resolve
the question of the reliability in predicting CRT flicker from
experiments which used homogeneous fields.

The homogeneous stimulus was generated by a fluorescent
lamp behind an almost perfect light diffusing glass. The CRT displayed
a plain raster of 2287 active lines on a screen 2lcm by 30cm, and was
viewed from a distance of 50cm. The screen therefore subtended
approximately 12 by 16 degrees of visual angle. Several levels of
screen luminance were used, and frequencies from 120HzZ down to 15 Hz.
Frame rates between 60Hz and 120 Hz used a 2:1 interlace while the
lower frame rates, generated by skipping fields, were non-interlaced
ane contained only half as many lines. The modulation depth of the
homogeneous field was varied by varying the mark:space ratio of the
drive to the fluorescent tubes, and for the CRT by optically
superimposing the homogeneous field whilst varying the DC drive to
the tubes.

The results are published only for 2 luminance levels,

50 and 100cd/sq m. In both cases the maximum frequency at which
flicker was visible was a little over 50 HZ, and so useq a non-
interlaced format. The plots of modulation depth required to. see
flicker on 50% of the presentations vs frequency are very similar for
homogeneous and non-homogeneous fields at frame rate above 15 Hz, but
CFF for the homogeneous field is always higher. However the difference
between the CRT display and the homogeneous field is of the same
magnitude as the difference between subjects, and although van der Zee
et al. concluded that it is safe to estimate flicker thresholds for
CRTs from modulated homogeneous fields, the comparison is not
complete. No results are given for CRT scans which used interlace
(which may well have behaved differently), and the maximum modulation
depth used was 1. At this depth of modulation the output from _ the
lightbox would have been equal to the mean light output from the CRT,
and therefore untypical of television viewing conditions.

b) Chaplin and Freemantle

Chaplin and Freemantle (1987) of IBM UK Labs have used
an optical sensor, not unlike a spot photometer with a field of view
of about 2 degrees, connected to a computer to extract the temporal
Fourier components from different VDU displays. The results could be
displayed graphically, overlaid with scaled and normalised subjective

. flicker fusion curves for various target sizes. Depending on whether
the fundamental component cuts the flicker fusion curves, the
perception of flicker can be predicted. The reference point which
links the fusion curves with the Fourier analysis is a modulation of
200cd/sq m peak to peak. The ordinate is plotted in dB and so this

9

point is 0dB. Figure 4 shows an example.

The problem, of course, is in finding appropriate
subjective fusion curves. Chaplin and Freemantle chose to collect
their own data from 100 subjects using an array of flashing LEDs. The
average intensity was 150cd/ sq m and three field sizes were used, 5,
15, and 20 degrees. The data are included in their computer programme
and intended to represent the upper sensitivity of 85% of the
population.

However, in collecting the subjective data no account
has been taken of the effects of ambient lighting level or any
additional effects due to patterned flicker. The conclusions of van
der Zee et al are assumed to be universally true and in addition, it
is not clear how these flicker fusion data should be applied to vDUs
which cannot achieve a mean luminance 150 cd/sq m. Therefore, for all
the sophistication of the objective measurement, it would seem that
the final predictions are only a gross approximation.

1.4 Optimum Viewing Conditions.

A consideration of the factors in section 1.1 suggests
that the optimum viewing conditions to minimise flicker would involve
viewing small dim monitors, from long distances in dimly lit rooms. In
practice, these factors have to be balanced against the need to be
able to resolve enough detail in the picture and the need to carry out
concurrent tasks, such as paperwork. In addition, were it not for the
flicker, large bright screens would be much preferred.

Some guidelines suggested by Cakir, Hart ané Stewart
(1979) for the use of computer VDUs are as follows:-

Contrast ratio characters:background, 10:1]
Contrast ratio background:surrounding, 1:3

2
Character luminance of 80-150cd/m

2

Screen background luminance of 15-20 cd/m
Ambient light level of 300-500 lux
Display subtends 20 degrees

Although there are differences between VDUs and
television displays, namely that computer VDUs often use long
persistence phosphors and non-interlaced scanning, and are frequently
required to display only two brightness levels, character and
background, these viewing conditions could be applied to television
displays. However a maximum contrast ratio of 10:1 when displaying a
continuum of luminances by television, represents a severe compression
of the contrast ratios which may occur in the scene (for instance, on
a bright sunny day a maximum of 10,000:1 might be found) and any

10

restrictions imposed on the already limited range of contrast that can
be carried by television could be unacceptable.

To minimise flicker it is also important that the
display monitor black-level is set correctly. If parts of the picture
which should be black are reproduced as some intermediate shade of
grey, it is possible that they will appear to flicker. Such flicker
can be avoided by adjusting the monitor correctly.

Welde and Cream (1972) suggest that, although it is
possible to minimise flicker in these ways, optimising the viewing
conditions does not significantly reduce the flicker when a display is
in the field of peripheral vision. This, together with the limiting
nature of such “optimal” viewing conditions clearly indicates a need
for reducing flicker at its source.

2.0 Reducing Flicker at Source

There are two obvious, physical ways of reducing the
amount of flicker generated by a display; prolonging the phosphor
persistence and increasing the field rate.

2.1 Phosphor Persistence.

An increase in phosphor persistence would reduce the
amplitude of the fundamental component of the flicker by both reducing
the overall amplitude and changing the waveform. Unfortunately, as
phosphorescence decays exponentially it is very difficult to achieve
any reduction of flicker by this means without blurring moving
pictures. This may be acceptable for computer VDUs where blurring is
only apparent on scrolling the screen, but for television used for
remote viewing this could be a distinct disadvantage.

2.2 Increasing the Scan Rate.

The most attractive means of reducing flicker would be
to increase the fundamental frequency.

a) High scan rate cameras and monitors.

Technically, it is possible to build display monitors
which operate at field rates greater than 50 or 60HzZ and increasingly
such options are offered for computer displays.

Equally, it is possible to build high scan rate cameras
with increased resolution, but these will be incompatible with
existing video equipment such as video recorders and vision mixers.
This is usually a serious disadvantage for closed-circuit television
but seldom a problem for computer displays. The provision of Suitable

ll

recording equipment is likely to be costly. In addition, the increased
signal bandwidth will be a difficulty in the distribution (and if the
signals are in anyway broadcast, the transmission) of the pictures
from such cameras.

b) Digital Signal processing

The problems of incompatibility and increased signal
bandwidth can be circumvented by converting conventional television
pictures to a format with increased field and/or line rates
immediately prior to display ona high scan rate monitor; thus
providing a flicker-free and probably non-interlaced display of
standard video signals.

Apart from simply upgrading conventional television, it
is expected within the television industry, that by using similar
techniques, it will be possible to minimise the transmission bandwidth
used by a high definition television service and be compatible with
existing picture sources and displays. Therefore, this is an active
area of research and with the advent of cheap and readily evailable
digital field storage will become a realistic proposition even for the
domestic market.

The fundamental problem is how to construct the
additional lines to enable a higher field rate. For parts of the
picture which do not change from frame to frame the solution is easy
Since the same information is transmitted over and over; repeat the
previous field; but where there is movement in the picture there is no
Such redundancy.

Many of the experimental approaches aim for a _ field
rate of 100H2 or 120 Hz; double that of 625/50/2:1 and 525/60/2:1
respectively. If interlacing is retained then the line scan rate is
doubled, while converting to a progressive scan mode quadruples the
dine scan rate. Unfortunately, conversion algorithms which work well
for still pictures are not optimal for parts of the picture which are
moving, and vice versa. It is therefore necessary to switch algorithms
between or within frames when movement has been detected. Conversions
which do this are said to be motion adaptive.

Essentially, algorithms which are good for still
pictures combine, in some way, the information from temporally
different fields, whilst algorithms good for moving pictures only use
information from a Single field. For example, to produce a progressive
scan ( i.e to scan lines 1,2,3 etc in numerical order rather than to
scan them in1,3,5.....2,4,6 order) from an interlaced scan at the
same field rate it is necessary to insert additional lines into the
Original fields. This could be achieved either by repeating lines
from the appropriate part of a previous field, or by repeating lines
from the same field. The first solution would be good for still
pictures and would have a better vertical resolution than the second.
However the second would allow jitter-free reproduction of moving
pictures.

12

The following are some examples of proposed
conversions; the list is by no means exhaustive.

i) The Sony approach.

For 625/50/2:1 Sony have investigated conversion to
625/100/2:1 (Okada, Hongu, Tanaka 1985 ). Interlace is retained and
the field rate is 100Hz, each field containing the normal number of
lines (312.5). The additional fields are obtained simply by
repetition.

If:-

Al A2 Bl B2 Cl C2 D1 D2 & arexenaieie @ & 0%

represents the 625/50/2:1 field sequence where
A,B,C...are the frames and 1,2 are the odd and even fields
respectively, then after conversion the sequence is:-

Al Al AZ A2 Bl Bl B2 B2 Cl Cl C2 C2 D1 D1 D2........

The advantages of this system are that large area
flicker is eliminated, only a single field store is needed and that
moving parts of the picture are only marginally disturbed, as there is
no change in the temporal ordering of the fields; There is no need for
motion adaption and fuzziness of moving edges is reported to be
negligible. The disadvantage of the conversion is that interline
flicker is unchanged at 25Hz.

Also, Sony have marketed a converter, the DSC 10, to
convert 525/60/2:1 to a non-interlaced scan, with a field rate of
60Hz, using a one-line memory. Line scan rate is doubled and there are
525 lines per field. The additional lines in each field (an
unconverted field has 262.5 lines) can be generated in two ways and it
is possible to switch between the two. The first simply repeats the
previous line and the second inserts the mean value of the two
adjacent lines. However, vertical resolution is reduced, but as noted
elsewhere not by as much as might be expected (i.e. halved)

ii) The Jackson and Annagarn approach

This is essentially the same as the Sony 625/100/2:1
approach except that it is motion adaptive. The resulting field
sequence where a picture contains movement is exactly the same, but
when no movement is detected then the field sequence becomes:-

Al A2 Al A2 Bl B2 Bl B2 Cl C2 Cl C2 D1 D2 Dil D2......

The advantage is that, for still parts of the picture
interline flicker frequency has been doubled and the picture is
largely flicker free. However it can be seen that the original
temporal order of some of the fields is reversed (e.g. Al A2
becomes AZ Al) so even small amounts of movement will be very jittery;
the motion adaption must be reliable. In addition it is no longer
possible to use a single field store.(Schroder, Silverberg, Wendland,

13

Huerkamp 1985.)

iii) The Tanaka, Nishizawa method.

This carries out the conversion of 625/50/2:1 to a
progressive scan mode with 100 fields/second. The result is line and
large area flicker-free for still pictures and resolution is
subjectively improved. However motion adaption is necessary and moving
parts of the picture show line and large area flicker. (Schroder et al
1985 )

Information is taken from three pre-conversion fields
to make up each new frame, which is then displayed twice. For a
625/50/2:1 field sequence:-

Al A2 Bl B2 Cl C2 D1 D2wis & FF KK

when no movement is detected in the picture, the
following frame sequence is constructed:-

Aa Aa Ab Ab Ba Ba Bb Bb Ca Ca Cb Cb Da Da Db Db......

Where the frame Ba is made up from the lines of field
Bl with the line-by-line average of the fields A2 and B2 inserted to
complete the progressive scan. Similarly the frame Cb is made up from
the lines of field CZ plus the average of fields Cl and Dl. ‘Thus a
complete frame is made up from three fields.

When motion is detected in the picture the sequence
becomes: -

Al°A1°A2°A2°B1°B1°B2°B2°C1°C1°C2°C2°D1°D1°D2°D2”.....

Here Al” is generated entirely from the field Al; the
additional lines are interpolated from their neighbours within the
field by averaging.

When motion detection fails the effect is of picture
blur rather than jitter but the system is complex and at least 4 field
stores are needed.

iv) The Wendland Way

This is Similar to the above in that it produces a
progressive scan at 100 frames/sec, with the advantage of being
completely flicker free in the still mode, but here the frames are
generated simply by combining odd and even fields. (Schroder et al
1985)

14

The sequence:-

Al A2 Bl B2 cl C2 D1 D2k & i awers,%
becomes: -
Z 2 Y¥ Y X X W W V V UD U T TT S Saeeeee

where Y is all the lines of fields Al and A2, X all the
lines of fields A2 and Bl, W of Bl and B2 etc.

When movement is detected the sequence is exactly the
same as iii). The advantage is simplicity, but against this is a
reduced tolerance to failure of movement detection. Switching of the
conversion mode has to take place for smaller amounts of picture
movement.

v) BBC Research Department Experiments.

Using two basic algorithms, one for still pictures and
one for motion, a number of standards conversions have been tried,
ranging from 625/50/l1:1 to 1250/100/4:1 and 1250/100/2:1 (Roberts
1962).

The still algorithm was basically the same as the
Jackson method when interlace was retained and the same as the
Wendlanad method for non-interlaced scans. For moving pictures the
algorithm was the same as the moving picture part of the Tanaka et
al. algorithm. The conversion to 1250/100/2:1 was simply a version of
625/50/l:1 with a 50Hz, one line vertical perturbation and twice the
line scan frequency. 1250/100/4:1 was similarly related to 625/50/2:1.

As expected, the conversions which involve a
quadrupling of the line rate (ie 1250/100/2:1 and 625/100/1:1) give
the best results in terms of reduction of large area flicker, inter-
line flicker and line crawl. The 4:1 interlace structures do not
perform very well as it is difficult to achieve a stable 4:1
interlace.

All the conversions resulting in a 100HzZ fielc rate
lead to considerable reduction in large area flicker, but vary in
their reduction of interline flicker. Only an algorithm equivalent to
the Sony method did not need to be motion adaptive.

vi) Motion detection.

Although motion adaptive conversion techniques
potentially offer the most improvement in picture quality, one of the
problems is signal noise. Being random in nature, the noise changes
from field to field and so may look like motion to a_ sensitive
detector. However, since random noise is likely to change much more
frequently, from pixel to pixel, from line to line, and from field to
field, than real movement, averaging horizontally, vertically and over
several fields will give a degree of immunity to noise. The penalty is
complexity and the amount of processing to be done in a finite amount

15

of time.

So far, the results of using motion adaptive conversion
are not entirely successful for real television pictures. (Roberts
1985)

2.3 Other Scan Structures

For a linear scanning system it is possible to broaden
each line without reducing horizontal resolution in the way that
simply enlarging the spot size would by adding a small, high frequency
(for example 200 times line frequency) vertical oscillation to the
scan raster. Such “Spot Wobble” techniques are not new, but given that
picture quality iS subjectively diminished by the visibility of
interline flicker (White 1978), hiding the line structure in this wey
may improve the appearance of interlaced pictures.

Scannina schemes other than linear scanning have been
suggested to reduce flicker for a given frame rate. One such’ scheme
would display an image made up from a mosaic of a large number of
dots, like a newspaper photograph, which would be illuminated in a
pseudo-random sequence (Deutsch 1971). The display would not so much
flicker as scintillate. Whilst such displays have been built, their
main application has been in television systems for low bandwidth
operation where bandwidth is conserved by sacrificine picture
repetition rate rather than the number of elements in eéch picture;
temporal rather than spatial resolution has been compromised. Problems
lie in the complexity of synchroniSing the picture source with the
display, and with maintaining a scan stable enough to achieve
reasonable spatial resolution.

3.0 Adverse Effects of Flicker.

Although there is much reported study of the use of
vbUs, the incidence of visual impairment and the occurrence of
fatigue, the case for a causal link is not proven. Even less concrete
is the putative isolation of flicker as the prime suspect. However
there is some evidence to suggest that flicker has a detrimental
effect on eye movements, and given that moderate levels of flicker are
unpleasant to work with, it is not unreasonable to speculate on such a
connection. It is assumed that the following also applies to the use
of television for a visually demanding task, but probably not to
domestic television watching.

3.1 CRTs, Fatigue and Visual Impairment.

Visual fatigue can mean a lot of things:-Subjective
variables such as "eyestrain", blurred vision, headaches, eye pains
etc; or objective variables such as deterioration of performance with
time on a task; or changes in psychophysically measurable aspects such

16

as spatial contrast sensitivity, or flicker sensitivity. Study methods
can be experimental, etiological, or can correlate questionnaire
results with the use of VDUS; but to generalise, the incriminating
evidence is equivocal.

a) Experimental evidence

An experiment by Gould and Grischkowsky (1984)
measured the performance, feelings (16 point questionnaire) and vision
of 24 subjects, at 1 hourly intervals during a 6 hour day of
proofreading from either a VDU or hard copy. The visual measures were
far and near acuity, phoria, flicker sensitivity and contrast
sensitivity. The results show that subjects experience some fatigue
during the day, but there is no significant difference between reading
from a VDU or a piece of paper. The experiment was designed so that
the two display conditions were as similar as possible and subjects
acted as their own controls by doing the experiment under both
conditions. Gould and Grischkowsky contend, that any additional
fatigue caused by the use of VDUS is in fact due to the type of work
done, rather than VDU use per se; this appears to be supported; when
the task is eguivalent the fatigue is the same.

Exactly the opposite conclusion was reached by the
authors of a Similar study, Mourant, Lakshmanan and Chantadisai
(1981). Here the task was a visual search task. Fatigue was measured
by the times taken for subjects to move their eyes from a near point,
the task sheet, to a far point, a TV monitor 6m away, read a five
Gigit number and re-focus on the task. The experiment was run in three
hour sessions and there was evidence of significant fatigue when the
task was VDU based, but not when the task was on hard copy. This
result is not exactly comparable with the above experiment, as fewer
and different measures of visual fatigue have been used.

b) An etiological approach

Subjects in the Dutch telephone inquiries service were
Studied before, just after and two years after the introduction of
vVbDUs. (de Groot and Kamphuis 1983 ). On the whole no change in the
number or severity of eyestrain complaints was evident, and no
changes in acuity or accommodation were found which could not be
accounted for by aging or by a change of glasses to Suit the new
working conditions. However CFF measured just after, was higher than
immediately prior to the introduction of VDUs. Two years later CFF had
declined, the authors suppose due to the process of aging, to a value
close to that before vDUsS. It was not found that the increase in CFF
was correlated with any increase in complaints of eyestrain.

c) Correlation and Causality

Laubli, Hunting and Grandjean (1980), surveyed the
visual complaints of 4 groups of office workers in relation to their
working conditions. Amongst other things, they measured the Uniformity
Factor (UF) of the VDUs which their respondants were using. UF was
defined simply as the lowest divided by the highest screen luminance
measured during one field and integrated over an area of about 1sq mm

17

of displayed text. Note that this is a fairly poor objective measure
as it takes no account of waveform or frequency.

Laubli et al. found a significant correlation between
workers who operated VDUS with low Uniformity Factors and the
incidence of reduced visual acuity. These unfortunates were also found
to be more likely to complain of red eyes, of shooting and burning
pains and to use eye-drops more frequently than operators of high
uniformity factor VDUs.

However a correlation does not indicate causality. In
this case the users themselves set the controls on their VDUs, and,
for a given display, it appears that one of the main determinates of
uniformity factor is display contrast. It is therefore plausible that
some of the workers, already suffering from poor acuity, had increased
the contrast (and hence decreased UF) in an attempt to make their
display more legible. The direction of causality is not necessarily
from low UF to low acuity; From a single survey it is impossible to
tell.

3.2 Flicker and Visual Performance.

It is frequently found that the reading of text is 103%
to 30% slower from aVDU than from a piece of paper (Gould = and
Grischkowsky ) and that blink rate is often higher (Mourant,
Lakshmanan and Chantadisai) than when reading from hard-copy.

Mousaoui and Frievalds (1986) have compared eye
movement patterns of subjects reading from a CRT or from paper. They
found that there are significant differences, principally in the
frequency and duration of fixation. Fixation pauses where the eye is
held steady, and information is captured, occur more frequently, and
fixations with a duration greater than 360msec are more common using
CRTS. Mousaoui and Frievalds suggest that the difference, which is
found even for short texts, and therefore has little to do with
fatigue, is largely due to the difficulty the eye has in accommodating
when there is a relative lack of high spatial frequencies in the CRT
display.

However, even when care is taken to ensure that the
paper and VDU displays are very similar, a difference in reading speed
is still sometimes found. Further possible explanation is provided
by Wilkins (1986) in an experiment which meaSured the size of saccadic
eye movements across text, firstly when the text was displayed on a
CRT and secondly when illuminated by fluorescent light. The subjects
were not asked to read the text but simply to transfer their point of
fixation from one specified letter to another. In both cases there was
a significant interaction between frequency of illumination and _ the
size of high velocity saccadic eye movements. For the CRT, at two
field rates, 50 and 100 Hz ( with no interlace) the eyes overshot
their target, allowing for the normal transient saccadic overshoot,
but by a significantly larger amount for the 50Hz field rate. The
overshoot for the 50HzZ rate corresponds to about the size of one of
the letters which made up the text. Under fluorescent lightino the

18

same sort of overshoot was apparent when the driving frequency was
100Hz, but when the flicker frequency was 20kHz an undershoot of about
the same size was found.

Whilst it is quite normal for the eye to undershoot a
target, the overshoots are unusual and need to be explained, It is
also of interest that the effect is concrete even when no flicker is
perceived and that subjects, when asked, preferred the 100Hz to the
50HzZ CRT display, but mostly were unable to say why.

It is possible to record electrical signals from
electrodes attached to the scalp which are phase locked to the
flickering of an intermittent stimulus. In a Situation similar to
television viewing, Tyler (1981) recorded such evoked potentials at
frequencies of up to 80HzZ even though the test field appeared
completely steady at about 50HzZ. Further, Brindley (1962) has shown
that the beat between electrical and visual stimulation of the retina
can be perceived at stimulating frequencies up to 120 Hz, where
either form of stimulation alone would not produce the sensation of
flicker.

Tt therefore would appear that the visual system can
responc to intermittent illumination even when flicker is not
perceived. The implication is that critical flicker fusion may no
longer be an adequate criterion for optimising field rate and that the
intermittancy of illumination does have an adverse effect on visual
performance.

However an experiment by the authors (Scheiwiller,
Reading, Dumbreck and Abel 1988) failed to find any large differences
in the times taken by subjects to perform a visual search task at
various field rates. The task was to count the number of small
circular ‘targets” hidden in a background pattern of random noise.
Field rates of 50,80 and 100HzZ were used, non-interlaced, and _ the
viewing conditions were such that flicker was not noticeable in the
pictures even at 50HZ. Two display monitors were used; one for 50Hz
and 80Hz, the other for 50 and 100HzZ, thus there were two 50Hz
conditions. Figures 5 and 6 show the mean time taken to count’ the
targets vs. the number of targets presented.

The error rate was constant across the field rates anc
there was no statistically significant difference in time taken
between 50 and 80 Hz. At 100HZ subjects performed slightly slower than
at 50HzZ and the difference was statistically significant. However this
difference is smaller than the difference between the two 50Hz
conditions and probably explained by a practice effect not anticipated
in the experimental design, and therefore of little practical
importance.

The search task in the above was not suited to a square
search strategy and eye movements are likely to have been less
orderly than those found in reading; perhaps the interaction between
display intermittency and visual performance is strong only when the
pattern of eye movement is highly ordered.

19

4.0 Conclusions

For a typical CRT display, with a field rate in the
region of 50 to 75Hz, flicker will be visible under some viewing
conditions; the likelihood that flicker will be perceived can be
minimised by optimising the viewing conditions.

This can be done by making the ambient lighting
subdued, but it must be bright enough to be able to carry out any
concurrent work, for example paperwork; and by keeping the display
brightness and contrast as low aS possible, consistent with the
display being able to fulfill its intended purpose efficiently. The
display black-level should be correctly set and the viewing distance
should be such that the screen subtends about 20 degrees of visual
angle.

However such conditions are very restrictive, large
bright screens are to be preferred. If it is unavoidable that a
display will always be in peripheral vision, for example where
several displays are usec at once, or the display iS part of a bank of
TV monitors then it is unlikely that even such viewing conditions will
eliminate flicker.

Interlace will be most disturbing at close viewing
Gdistances. If a fixed viewing distance, from which the picture line
structure is inviSible, cannot be guaranteed then interlace is
probably best avoided.

Flicker can be reduced by increasing the persistence of
the phosphor, but this will only be effective when the increase is
relatively large and blurring of moving pictures will occur.

Digital scan conversion of conventional TV signals to
a format with a higher field rate and without interlace, immediately
prior to display would appear to be the best way of reducing flicker
for TV applications. It has the advantage over systems which use a
high scan rate throughout that conventional and compatible equipment
can be used for the rest of the system. It is probable that such
processing will become widely available, even for domestic TV
receivers within the next few years. However to be really effective
the conversion has to be motion adaptive, and at present reliable
motion detection is fairly difficult. Possibly, the advantages of up-
conversion will be slightly marred by artifacts created when motion
detection fails. When the equipment becomes commercially available
(for the moment it is still experimental) this potential, and the
possible advantages of simply de-interlacing the picture should be
evaluated more fully.

There iS evidence to suggest that the human visual
system responds to intermittent illumination at frequencies above
flicker fusion, and that flicker might have an adverse effect on
visuai performance even at high frequencies. This implies that flicker
fusion may not always be a good enough criterion for deciding the
field rate and viewing conditions. Whether or not flicker has any

20

effect on visual fatigue or, in the long term, on health is not
conclusively decided.

However, an experiment by the authors failed to find
any major interaction between display field rate and an observers
performance of an unstructured visual search task. This is not
consistent with other findings, in particular those of Wilkins where
there was a relationship between saccade size and display field rate.
Perhaps the interaction is strong only where regular, predictable eye
movements are involved, as in reading and that any detrimental effects
of flicker are task dependent.
