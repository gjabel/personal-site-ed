ABSTRACT
Work at Harwell Laboratory over the last five years has concentrated
on developing telerobotic techniques that can be used in the nuclear
industry. The approach has been to apply available equipment,
modify available equipment, or design and build anew. We _ have
successfully built an input controller which can be used with standard
industrial robots, converting them into telerobots. A clean room
industrial robot has been re-engineered into a nuclear engineered
advanced telerobot, using a knowledge of radiation tolerance design
principles and _ collaboration with the manufacturer. A powerful
hydraulic manipulator has been built to respond to a need for more
heavy duty devices for in-cell handling. A variety of easy to use 3-D
TV systems have been developed to enable versatile totally remote
teleoperated systems to become viable options for the nuclear
industry. Each of these examples required careful attention to be
paid to design criteria, performance evaluation, application studies,
trials and human interaction. The philosophy that has been used in
their development is presented, together with a description of the
resultant hardware.
INTRODUCTION
Nuclear remote handling is an ideal field for conservatism. New plant
design is always constrained by the available [and proven] techniques
demonstrated in existing plant. Plant designers and operators need
sufficient and substantial proof of new techniques before they can be
incorporated into active plant proposals or even into pre-construction
pilot studies. Research groups, in comparison, tend to develop
equipment which may not address operational needs, and which can be
difficult to operate economically in real applications. In __ principle,
both groups should be able to realize common objectives, develop new
equipment to advance plant design and produce innovation which
refreshes the possibilities of achieving more complex tasks in remote
handling more effectively.

Traditionally, research and development at Harwell Laboratory focussed
either on producing specialized equipment to well defined project
requirements, or on long-term objectives. Although this had advantages,
the carry-over of innovation from project to project was minimal,
especially in the case of control system design. In 1984 the prospect
of continually evolving new unique solutions to remote handling with
little benefit accruing from previous projects was not attractive. At
the same time, it was appreciated that innovation in the non-nuclear
application of mechanical handling, especially in industrial robotics,
had begun to outstrip progress in the nuclear industry. An _ extensive
assessment of technology that is needed for computer-aided remote
handling indicated that many of the techniques used in automation could
be readily transferred to nuclear applications, provided cognizance
was taken of the special requirements of the environment and difficulties
associated with remote maintenance.[1] For historic reasons, the UK
had not developed a commercially available electrically linked master
slave manipulator, and so the concept of producing a new type of
remote manipulator was considered. The new manipulator could be
based on a commercially available industrial robot but with the
addition of a teleoperation interface and environmental re-engineering.
In parallel with this reasoning, a heavy duty special purpose hydraulic
manipulator was being developed, as an upgrade to existing master
slave manipulators. 3-D TV systems were designed to ensure that
comfortable and easy to use remote viewing technology was available
for inspection of maintenance tasks, complementing the improved
potential of remote manipulation.
The three developments, of re-engineering an industrial robot, build-
ing 3-D TV systems and producing a hydraulic manipulator represent
combinations of the three basic routes to producing effective nuclear
remote handling equipment. The three routes are:

* apply available equipment

® modify available equipment

¢ design and build anew.
Distillation of the essence of a remote handing system reveals only
three major constituents. These are:

¢ an end effector that can be positioned and oriented at a distance

¢ transmission media for power and control

¢ a human operator with an objective.
Using an industrial robot with a human operator in real-time control
will realize all three constituents of remote handling. Topographical
constraints mean that such a solution is not a panacea for all applicat-
ions, but there are a significant number, especially in decommissioning

-2-

and waste management, where human operated robots can be applied.
The concept of using a robot with a human operator rather than a
predetermined programme managing trajectory control is commonly
known as_ telerobotics. Telerobotics defies exact definition, but we
describe it as a combination of all that is best in industrial robotics
with all the skills of a human operator to respond to ill defined and
unpredictable tasks.
To achieve telerobotic operation in a nuclear environment requires the
development of a teleoperation interface to a robot controller, and the
modification of a robot to suit the radiation environment in a reliable
and maintainable form[2].
This paper describes how our recent developments incorporate blends
of adaption and special design, and indicates the value that can be
gained by performance evaluation studies to refine hardware designs
or philosophy of application.
THE TELEOPERATION INTERFACE
A review of industrial robots highlighted the variable performance of
the control systems. Some manufacturers offered on-line path modific-
ation and the potential for telerobotic operation. The VAL II controller
from Unimation was selected as being a suitable benchmark and _ initial
trials using a scaled-down model master arm with similar kinematics,
confirmed the potential of such an approach. However, it was relatively
easy to trip out the robot controller by exceeding joint angle limits or
by trying to drive through arm singularities. A microprocessor based
kinematic model of the arm was derived and used to condition demands
from input devices such as joysticks or forceballs. The operator can
then drive the robot at full speed, as a telerobot, without compromising
the robot performance, or loosing the ability to execute programmed
operation. The latest version of the Harwell Input Controller [Figure
1} allows control of the robot in joint, world or tool co-ordinate
systems. The operator selects the mode of operation of the Input
Controller through a touch screen menu. Additional features include
speed scaling, and constrained motion - where specified degrees of
freedom can be supressed or constrained - allowing straight line,
planar motion or offset planar motion. These latest features give
significant improvements in tasks such as scanning complex surfaces
and drilling and cutting workpieces.
NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AN INDUSTRIAL ROBOT
One of the major benefits of adapting an industrial robot to a nuclear
environment is that any weaknesses in the mechanical design have been
discovered by the operation of hundreds of units. The Staubli
Unimation PUMA robot was selected as the ideal manipulator for nuclear
-3-

engineering. The design modification is based on a clean room PUMA
762 robot which has a full speed payload of 20kg. The arm design
has been thoroughly assessed in association with the manufacturer to
ensure that all components are suitable for the most demanding nuclear
environments. {mproved seals at each joint and a _ wrist  gaiter
minimize the ingress of contamination. The forearm can be easily
removed to improve maintainability and a reduced base cuts down the
weight of the arm. Wiring, connectors, bearings and other internal
elements have also been examined and radiation tolerant alternatives
have been produced where necessary.
The prototype Nuclear Engineered Advanced Telerobot [NEATER] will
be delivered to Harwell following this conference and the concluding
back fitting of improved performance components will begin. The
design target is for an integrated dose level of 106 Gy before the
need for a major overhaul occurs. Back fitting of components will
be complete in early 1990.
Initial cost estimates for production models of NEATER [the nuclear
engineered robot and an input controller] suggest significant cost
savings can be made compared to_ special purpose derived
manipulators designed to a similar specification. In addition, NEATER
is based on a family of industrial robot designs which are operating
success- fully in many different countries.
THE HYDRAULIC MANIPULATOR
The Harwell Hydraulic Master Slave Manipulator[3] is a_ specially
designed manipulator that can be used to directly replace existing
MSMs [Figure 2]. Mechanically linked MSMs have reached their limit-
ation in reach, and load capacity and are not particularly well suited
to the production environments associated with reprocessing and
waste handling. For those applications, loads are substantial and
MSM failures result in a loss in productivity and potentially high
costs in maintenance, spares inventories and _ staff radiation
exposures. The majority of MSMs do not incorporate load balancing
features and operator fatigue can be considerable.
The first machine built was rated at 23kg. Following successful
trials at Sellafield, in a decontamination cell serving two Magnox fuel
element decanning caves [4] the second version of the Hydraulic Man-
ipulator was designed for a load capacity of 35kg with a direct lift
capability of 350kg. The chosen fluid is water glycol operating at
210 bar and the manipulator is also controlled by a position differ-
ence servocontroller. A force reflecting master arm is under develop-
ment[5] to improve the performance of the manipulator, using a comb-
ination of control techniques. It will enhance dynamic performance |
-4-

and give the operator a sense of contact with the workpiece. A _ series
of tests and simulations have been carried out to optimize the master
joint actuators and a combination of direct drive, low transmission
ratio and high gear ratio drives have been specified.
3-D TV
For effective teleoperation, visual feedback is as, if not more,
important than force or position feedback from a manipulator. In
particular, 3-D or stereoscopic TV enables operators to accurately
assess the remote environment, for example, during inspection, or to
interact remotely, accomplishing complex tasks involving manipul-
ation or tool deployment. Studies began at Harwell to verify the
known potential of 3-D TV, by analysing the controllable parameters
which influence 3-D, building the best systems technically possible,
and measuring their performance in comparison to other TV
systems[6-8]. The use of TV systems in remote handling is usually
confined to observation; direct viewing is often the medium used for
manipulator or gantry control.
3-D TV gives the operator a perception of depth, scale, scene texture,
and a confidence that a manipulative task can be completed in unfamiliar
or cluttered environments. Other benefits are that often tasks can be
completed more quickly using 3-D TV than with systems based on
several 2-D TV arrangements, and sometimes new tasks that previously
had been impossible can now be contemplated.
To successfully engineer a 3-D TV system requires attention to both
display and cameras. Because the principle is to arrange simultaneous
display of two pictures with only a slight horizontal disparity, it is as
important to control the camera parameters as those in the display. The
observer can accept scaling of images easily. Attempts to display scenes
with excessive depth, or ones with vertical disparities or inconsistent
matching of images result in discomfort and resistance to use a system.
We have built several complete 3-D systems, black and white and colour,
and a radiation tolerant version, which are easy to use and can be used
comfortably over long periods of time. An early camera avoided using
zoom lenses [which in radiation tolerant forms are expensive and
bulky] by being constructed from four split-head cameras, each with
their own lenses. The cameras form two pairs, one with wide angle
lenses, one with narrow angle lenses [replacing the function of a
zoom] and the display technique is to use two good quality monitors
and a combining mirror. Camera pairs and monitors are optically
matched to ensure their alignments fall within our guideline values.
A colour system has been produced, [Fig 3] which uses off the shelf
cameras and a special lens mechanism. This mechanism, similar to those
-5-

in the earlier camera, controls focus and convergence simultaneously,
to maintain coincidence of focal and convergence planes. The display
[Fig 4] is designed to be moved to a position alongside an existing work-
station. A more compact display which can be built into a control desk
has been produced. The colour display has been used as a 3-D computer
graphics and simulation display.
Having gained experience in building experimental 3D-TV systems, and
confirming their benefits and ease of use, a radiation tolerant version
has been constructed, that is suitable for hot cells or reactor inspect-
ion. Its specification calls for operation at 150°C, it must have its
own lighting and be no more than 150mm in diameter.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS
Performance evaluations and trials of experimental or newly developed
equipment form an important part of the design process and are recom-
mended in accepted design ccriteria[9]. For manipulators, qualifying
performance to specification is often the most important task for new
models. In addition, Human Factors experimentation is useful in
identifying particular working techniques or equipment features that
could benefit from improvement. Some examples of our experience are given.
TELEROBOTICS APPLICATIONS
Two main applications of telerobotics have been investigated. The first
is the use of telerobotics to scan and monitor hot spots on a surface in
a regular manner, and to successively decontaminate the surface using
an electrochemical method. This example makes use of a computer based
kinematic model of the robot, its serving system and its target work-
place, establishing compatibility of hardware and the task[10]. The
simulation system has been used to provide off-line programmes for the
robot when not operating under teleoperation. By using the Harwell In-
put Controller, particular degrees of freedom can be constrained to
provide restricted motion, for example pure planar or pure linear
motion. With feedback from position sensors, offsets and _ controlled
compliant forces can be applied to an arbitrary-oriented workpiece which
is necessary for effective deployment of the decontamination head.
The second application of telerobotics involves using slightly modified
industrial tools to achieve size reduction of plant items such as glove-
boxes. The telerobot deploys the tool under teleoperation [Fig 5] and
the glovebox can be reduced by nibbling, sawing, grinding or drilling.
This task is currently carried out by pressurized-suit workers, and a
telerobotic solution can show a potential benefit in a longer cutting
working day and less risk to personnel.

-6-

The use of available tools with compliant tool mounting plates works
well. Tools which contain reaction forces and torques are preferable,
to reduce wear in the robot transmission. If the task is not close to
an operator acoustic feedback is helpful to determine tool feedrates
under teleoperation. 3-D TV has been used in this application, and
with the addition of control software in the Harwell Input Controller
similar to the decontamination application, tool feeds can be constrain-
ed to be parallel or normal to the glovebox surface even though the
telerobot co-ordinate system is not aligned to the workpiece. A_ single
six degree of freedom input device has been used to control the tele-
robot in tool or world coordinates, and we will extend our work to allow
tool and interaction forces to be fed back to a force reflecting master
input device.
The target application is envisaged as only semi-automated. To achieve
a completely reliable tool package which will not need re-setting or
replacement, and to develop a tool change station is not considered
necessary, in this instance. Instead, the operator of the telerobot
will be able to use glove ports to change tools, replace broken blades
and maintain end effector tooling. Figure 6 shows such an _ operation
- changing a broken blade. The telerobot control is interlocked out
before access to the glove ports is possible, and the telerobot and
tool just cannot reach the glove port wall.
EVALUATION OF VIEWING SYSTEMS
Many evaluations of viewing systems have taken place in the Viewing
Laboratory Fig 7.
Initially, simple comparisons of performance between high definition
and 3-D TV systems gave way to more complex applications of TV
involving some form of manipulator task. Comparisons have been made
using force reflecting manipulators, a variety of task boxes and
sorting tasks where depth information is important to avoid uncertainty
in unstructured environments. Trials at Windscale Nuclear Laboratory
have compared performance benefits of 3-D TV over orthogonal TV in
operations such as remotely cropping reinforcing bar using an_ industr-
ial robot carrying a hydraulic tool[8). Another experiment, also at
Windscale, evaluated the benefit of a colour 3-D TV system in a
decommissioning operation which involved handling large steel plates
representing samples of cut reactor pressure vessel. The plates had
to be grabbed by a crane and located precisely in a rack prior to
cementation [11].
A visual perception experiment has investigated the effect of flicker
rates on visual search tasks for different frame rate displays[{12].
Some guidelines for reducing flicker in control rooms have been set,
and work in this area continues.

LESSONS LEARNED
Our experience gained during the evaluations and trials covers a
variety of effects. Human factors experiments associated with the trials
give insight into the subtle effects of operator performance and _ sensiti-
vity to ineffective equipment.
Telerobotics using industrial robots has required the development of a
special microprocessor based input controller. The benefit is that the
attributes of the robot controller and the robot performance are not
degraded by teleoperation. The input controller can take a choice of
input devices, allows a selection of control modes such as tool alignment,
predeterminate degrees of freedom, tool offset or compliance, scaled tip
speed and can act as a conditioning unit for sensor information used to
actively control the telerobot trajectory. Six degree of freedom hand
controllers are available which can be used to control the robot at low
cost, and are simple to operate.
Re-engineering a robot for the nuclear environment is not a_ trivial
task. However, by careful analysis of the materials and construction,
radiation tolerance can be built into a design which differs only
slightly from production machines. To accomplish re-engineering
requires a good working relationship with the robot manufacturer, to
ensure a thorough understanding of the initial design principles and
the manufacturing techniques involved.
For the Hydraulic Manipulator, active trials have confirmed the
performance of the prototype machine, and the experience of failures
and their remedy has led to an improved machine being produced. The
new machine has a stronger wrist, a greater load capacity, and can be
installed from the cold face with a gaiter already fitted. It will fit
into a 254mm MSM port, and has an extended reach. The basic manip-
ulator does not have force feedback, and an alternate input to a kine-
matically similar master arm is a simple box containing potentiometers
for position demands. The trials highlighted the need for post-repair
pre-installation tests, and training courses for maintenance and _ operat-
ional staff. A  shrink-fit sheath on the original arm was effective in
reducing contamination traps and _ resulted in acceptable levels for
contact maintenance following simple swabbing. The jaw assemblies
were decontaminated using a caustic bath, and a jaw change station
was used to automatically replace damaged end effectors.
The manufacture of 3-D TV displays and cameras has confirmed the
design guidelines can be achieved by careful attention to detail.
Although in some cases 3-D TV shows no significant benefit in the
time of a simple operation, many typical remote handling tasks require
complex decision making processes relating to an operator’s perception
-8-

of unfamiliar or ill-ordered scenes. If the quality of manipulation is
good, and the task requires ballistic motions in cluttered or restricted
workspaces, then 3-D TV shows a significant improvement in perform-
ance of the task compared to single 2-D TV or combinations of cameras.
3-D TV is not as critically dependent on position or deployment through-
out a task and is not so badly affected by lighting variations. In
short for any task that requires judgements to be made about surface
texture [inspection] or interaction of a manipulator, 3-D TV _ shows
tangible and significant benefits compared to other TV techniques. The
budget allocated to TV systems in a remote handling systems should at
least be on par with the manipulator system. Experiments which include
observation of the operator give a better insight into performance than
do the classical analyses of task and subtask completion times. In
particular, operator fatigue, and strategies for task completion can be
identified as the experimental video record is analysed.
CONCLUSIONS
Non-active trials are necessary to confirm performance and strategy of
operation, and computer simulation helps avoid uncertainty. Human
Factors assessments of the trials allows an insight to be gained into
the subtle effects of operator performance and sensitivity to ineffective
equipment. Specialized equipment is necessary for existing and future
plant, but significantly our work has indicated that there is a very
strong rdle for modified equipment to be brought into the nuclear
marketplace. 3-D TV has become a _ useful tool and with NEATER,
promises to be a cost effective alternative satisfying the need for new
adjacent and remote handling techniques.
