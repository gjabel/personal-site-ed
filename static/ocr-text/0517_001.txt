Harwell Projects Department, MTRs, Stage 2:
UKAEA Research Reactors Division, 1967 Phase 1 decommissioning complete, 1998
Introduction
Decommissioning Harwell’s two 26MW(th) Materials Test Reactors (MTRs) was started as soon as
operations ceased and both were shut down on 31st March 1990. Stages 1 and 2: phase 1,
decommissioning included defuelling, removal of all fissile and rigs’ sample materials, draining of
the heavy water and its transfer to Winfrith, removal of the balance of plant and demolition of most
of the surrounding buildings and facilities. That programme of work was completed by 1998. At
this point, the reactors were expected to stay in continuous Care and Surveillance until
approximately 2037 — 2040, by which time radioactive decay would have reached a point that
further delay would not show significant benefits in waste management cost saving nor in ease of
decommissioning. By then a National ILW Repository was expected to be available.
Several different dismantling plans for Stage 3 (decommissioning to green field) were proposed in
the period between 1990 — 2002; some examined options for early decommissioning but the best
option was always to defer. However, in 2003 — 2004, an accelerated programme was proposed
for decommissioning UKAEA facilities. For Harwell, the MTRs would be decommissioned by 2025
and the whole Harwell Site would be delicensed. Subsequent years’ programmes were improved
such that both of the MTRs could be decommissioned by December 2016, provided the Front End
Decommissioning Engineering and Regulatory engagement could be started in 2007.
The challenge for accelerated decommissioning was to produce safe and cost-effective strategies
using predominantly commercial off the shelf (COTS) equipment. However, the decommissioning
techniques proposed in the pre-2004 plans were not suited to such a rapid programme and the
original techniques were unduly complicated and expensive. Year-on-year improvements to the
plans have produced more efficient and cheaper methodologies that would make early
decommissioning possible, provided the funding and technical skills resource were available.
By 2008, national funding priorities for the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority have meant that the
UKAEA accelerated programmes have been re-assessed; the Harwell MTRs will remain in Care
and Surveillance until at least 2021, assuming funding levels are not further reduced.
Nevertheless, the improved approach to decommissioning will continue to be the baseline.

DIDO Operators Meeting, 16-17 April 2008, Roskilde, Denmark
Previous DIDO Operators’ Meetings, in particular the 1997 Julich Meeting, have had presentations
from Harwell about the status of decommissioning work. This paper will give a description of the
organisational changes that have happened, a brief pictorial overview of the DIDO and PLUTO
early decommissioning milestone events since shutdown, provide a few more details of the DIDO
HAHC decommissioning and describe the philosophy behind accelerated decommissioning plans.
Management Changes that have affected MTR decommissioning
UKAEA had begun to reorganise in the late 1980s into commercially-focused groups under the
banner AEA Technology (AEAT) and the MTRs decommissioning was managed within the
Decommissioning Group of Engineering Services. In October 1990, all UKAEA Sites were brought
under the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate’s licensing regime, which represented a step change
in safety management. A UKAEA Programme Management Group (the Corporate DRAWMOPS
Directorate, or CDD) authorised the budgets and the internal contracts with the decommissioning
projects. This structure stayed much the same until 1994 when AEA Technology was established
as the Commercial Division of UKAEA and CDD became part of UKAEA’s Government Division
(GD); Decommissioning Project Managers were part of AEAT but seconded into GD, and were
required to operate behind a “Chinese Wall” in commercial operations with AEAT. In 1996, AEAT
was established as a separate company but the secondees remained in UKAEA to ensure that
safety responsibilities and Regulatory compliance was maintained. At Harwell, the
Decommissioning Project Managers and Programme Managers were formed into one UKAEA unit,
the Harwell Projects Department (HPD). AEAT retained pre-existing UKAEA Intellectual Property
and key functional units such as nuclear engineering, decommissioning and radiological protection
stayed in AEAT.
Progress with MTRs decommissioning was initially rapid, with visible changes to the reactor
infrastructure. By 1995, the workforce had been reduced as most of the radiation work had been
completed. The remaining reactor-focused staff took responsibilities for the other Harwell
Reactors, GLEEP and BEPO and the three remaining Hangers.
The next significant management change was the establishment of the Nuclear Decommissioning
Authority (NDA) as defined in the 2004 Energy Act. NDA are now the owners of the old UKAEA
sites and UKAEA are Contractors to NDA, carrying out agreed programmes of work. Harwell and
Winfrith operate under an integrated management team and will soon become Research Sites
Restoration Ltd (RSRL), a UKAEA Group. NDA will compete the management of RSRL in the near
future.
Early decommissioning - the successful reduction of hazard
The shutdown of DIDO and PLUTO after approximately 34 years of operation was sudden.
Decommissioning planning had not been prominent in the minds of the reactor staff and managers.
Just six years before the closure announcements, the top shield plug had been replaced on
PLUTO. This improvement was in anticipation of much more than a decade of commercial and
experimental programmes, supporting industry and the new commercial reactor programmes that
were expected to replace the MAGNOX and some coal-fired stations that would come to the end of
their economic life in the next 20 years. Irradiation of materials such as silicon, production of
isotopes and neutron radiography were thriving, but essentially subsidised activities. Plans had
even been laid to build DIDO-2, a 50MW research reactor that would eventually take over from the
original MTRs, providing a more versatile and higher neutron flux resource.
However, the operational teams turned to decommissioning efficiently, despite the clear knowledge
that they were working themselves out of a job. The management structure stayed virtually the
same, initially, and early work such as defuelling, removal of samples from rigs and minor
decommissioning required the same skills set and operations that were needed in reactor
operation. Specific tasks such as the decommissioning of the DIDO High Active Handling Cell
were different and required new equipment, which fortuitously had been developed in Harwell's
Remote Handling & Robotics Department. The significance of this work is that it introduced a
radically new technology to solve difficult decommissioning problems.

The decommissioning plans followed the IAEA model of three stages, but Stage 1 was split into
three phases and Stage 2 was split into two phases.
The definitions for the MTR decommissioning phases were:
Stage 1 Phase 1 e Defuel & remove D,O
e Remove samples, except cobalt, from rigs
e Obtain approval for Safety Justification for Phase 2
Phase 2 e Remove less hazardous secondary systems external to block
e Obtain approval for Safety Justification for Phase 3
Phase 3 e Remove remaining Secondary System
e Unload cobalt from rigs
e Obtain approval for Safety Justification for Stage 2, Phase 1
Stage 2 Phase 1 e Complete Interim decommissioning & decontamination
e Decommissioning old ventilation systems and install new ones
e Obtain approval for Safety Justification for Stage 2, Phase 2
e Modify Safety Case, reduce category to Safety Category 3
Phase 2 e Extended Surveillance & Maintenance
The key events up to and including Stage 2, Phase1 were:

The DIDO High Activity Handling Cell
Initial decommissioning had already begun on the DIDO High Activity Handling Cell (HAHC) before
the closure of the MTRs. The HAHC had been used to support DIDO operations and latterly,
process °°Co. It had been closed since 1984 and placed in care and maintenance. Concerns over
its safety resulted in the start of refurbishment work in January 1989 as a precursor to full
decommissioning. During the initial attempt to remove the overhead power manipulator, in June
1991, one of its hydraulic hoses split, releasing an unknown quantity of oil into the cell. All
operations were stopped. Although attempts were made to clean up the cell, uncertainty about the
amount and distribution of oil and flammable debris within the cell prevented the use of plasma-arc
cutting techniques, the preferred method of gross size reduction of cell furniture and components.

The DIDO High Activity Handling Cell
The Harwell Remote Handling and Robotics Department (RHRD) had already developed a
radiation-tolerant industrial robot, NEATER, that could be controlled remotely. As part of a
systems engineering approach to modern remote handling, RHRD had also developed radiation
tolerant 3-D television systems, TV’. Both ranges of equipment had a designed and tested
radiation tolerance of beyond 1 MGy, but used commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components; they
were commercially available through AEA Technology. The first application of NEATERs was at
Sellafield for swabbing the outside of vitrified high level waste containers, and was delivered within
six months from receipt of BNFL’s order. The alternative from the Vitrification Plant’s original
designers was more expensive, was a unique and unproven design and was less flexible in
programmability and ease of control.
Another application for NEATER, at much lower activity levels, was at Harwell’s Chemistry Division
for size reduction of over 180 alpha-contaminated gloveboxes. A saving of £35k in reduced waste
disposal cost for each glovebox was seen and reduced the continuous need for costly and
hazardous pressurised suit operations.
Both applications demonstrated the versatility of the systems in nuclear applications and the very
significant savings that could be made, compared to the normal nuclear industry practice of the
time. As the development of NEATER and the supporting systems such as TV? were funded
through the same Department of Energy Programmes as the DIDO HAHC decommissioning, it
made sense to apply NEATER to solve the problem at the Reactor site. Because of the novel
application, and the experience gained through the TELEMAN programme, the Commission of the
European Communities (CEC) were asked if they would agree that the project was suitable for
matched CEC funding as a decommissioning task. In 1992, they agreed to support the use of
NEATER in decommissioning the DIDO HAHC, and the telerobot and ancillary equipment were
7

DIDO Operators Meeting, 16-17 April 2008, Roskilde, Denmark
installed in July — August 1993. This was the first decommissioning application of a radiation
tolerant telerobotic device, made from standard industrial robot components.
Reactor Decommissioning staff were trained by RHRD in the use of the new remote handling
equipment. The size-reduction of the in-cell facilities and furniture was completed quickly.
NEATER’s last job was to foam-clean all surfaces to bring background levels down to < 500uSv ""
(from >1 Sv’, contact, in some hotspots). In early March 1994 the telerobot was extracted and
the contamination control designs (labyrinth seals, strippable coatings and customised gaitering)
were found to have worked effectively so it could be cleared for transport and re-use.
Conservative estimates put the application of the robot as saving >80 mSv, £1.1M and reduced the
programme time by 2 years. However, it would have been a very difficult task to make an ALARP
justification for man-entry in such a dangerous and cluttered radioactive environment.

NEATER: size-reducing cell furniture NEATER: foam decontamination, post strip out
Once the cell was clean, conventional demolition techniques were used to reduce down the hulk of
the cell. One unusual characteristic of the HAHC was that it was a steel plated framework
structure with shielding volumes formed that were filled with sand. The HAHC had zinc bromide
windows and the Maintenance Bay area had shield doors fabricated in steel plate and filled with
lead shot. About 30 tonnes out of the 180 tonnes of sand was contaminated and had to be
disposed of as LLW, as did the cell roof plates and outer walls.

The process of dismantling and clearing the HAHC was completed by August 1994.

Accelerated Decommissioning
In 2004, UKAEA’s accelerated plans for decommissioning the Harwell Site by 2025 posed severe
challenges for decommissioning managers. For the MTRs, the assumption was always that
radioactive decay was worth the wait: by about 2040, the bulk of the activity in components would
have started to level off and the decommissioning would be relatively straightforward, with only a
few components requiring special arrangements. The bulk of the reactors would also have
decayed down below the 12G Bq t', which is the threshold between Intermediate and Low Level
Waste.

If the MTRs were to be decommissioned early, then the dismantling techniques would have to deal
with high activity components and would need to be performed remotely. Previous
decommissioning plans had not been refined in any detail and because the outcome of
optimization was to delay until 2030+, there had never been any serious technical review of the
techniques suggested.
Virtually all the schemes relied on un-defined, thin mast-mounted manipulators passing through
existing reactor top penetrations, deploying tools within the RAT. This followed the practice at
power reactor sites such as Niederaichbach, Fort St Vrain and WAGR. However all these reactors
had much larger internal diameters than the MTRs’ RATs. In the 1980’s, RHRD assisted the
Research Reactors Division with RAT NDT inspection, using an extended reach Walischmiller
master-slave-manipulator, borrowed from Lucas Heights. The deployment of cameras, the NDT
tooling and lighting was complicated by the restricted degrees of freedom available in such a
confined volume. If a decommission approach was to use a similar manipulative strategy, then it
would be likely to fail as there was virtually no means to provide adequate space for aggressive,
force-generating tools.

RAT NDT Inspection, using extended reach equipment
A review of techniques that might achieve early decommissioning considered what could be done
to improve on the plan. Experience of non-reactor decommissioning projects at Harwell such as
the Variable Energy Cyclotron, the Chemical Engineering Building facilities, the plan for sudden
JET decommissioning, all confirmed that the optimum decommissioning technique was to consider
how the decommissioning and waste management could be made most efficient, rather than
starting from operational or physical constraints fixed by the facilities topography. For the MTRs at
Harwell, the existence of the rigs and the lack of craneage and flasking that met Modern Standards
was a setback. The obvious access route to the reactor internals is by removing the top shield
plug but because of the high activity levels, additional structures would be needed to deal with the
most radioactive components, first.
Examination of research reactor decommissioning projects worldwide showed that tank reactors
and TRIGA reactors were being decommissioned using the same sorts of tools and remote
vehicles that had been developed and used by RHRD over several decades. BNFL had
decommissioned two small reactors in the UK, the Scottish Universities’ Argonaut reactor at East
Kilbride, and ICI’s TRIGA reactor at Billingham. Brokks were used at these locations.
In America, a US DOE Large Scale Demonstrator Project had occurred at ANL’s CP-5 reactor,
using advanced equipment from other US DOE labs and specialist suppliers. CP-5 was the
inspiration for DIDO but only ran at 5 MW, over 25 years. The activity levels did not warrant the
use of advanced remote handling but the research work that was published is a useful source for
decommissioning projects. Most of the techniques had already been examined and tried in Europe
in National Labs or through the CEC’s decommissioning or TELEMAN programmes.
CP-5 used Brokk mobile manipulators to demolish the reactor’s concrete pedestal, clear away the
biological shielding and remove underground embedded steelwork. Brokks have been used in
Europe in the nuclear industry since 1970, when the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology used
one to decommission their underground R1 reactor in Stockholm. There are now over 3000
Brokks in use in conventional demolition as well as hazardous environment work. There is a
nuclear hardened version.
The new approach for Harwell’s MTRs is to take advantage of the natural physical weakness of the
structure and use a Brokk to excavate the reactor internals from a horizontal pathway. The cut
away sections of the reactors show that there are easy access points associated with the
horizontal tubes and, for DIDO, the horizontal thermal column. An initial structural assessment
indicates that openings can be made through to the Reactor Steel Tank up to 2 m x 2 m without
compromising the strength of the remaining biological shielding. The vertical rigs would be
10

DIDO Operators Meeting, 16-17 April 2008, Roskilde, Denmark
withdrawn first, but as some of the horizontal rigs are known to be stuck, they would be removed
when exposed, by the Brokk. The base of the plug would be ripped away by the Brokk from below.

A set of Decommissioning Principles was generated for the new approach:
e retain the PLUTO AHB for training, mock-up tests and storage;
e build an auxiliary building with craneage, joined to the reactor shell;
e recondition the polar crane;
e recondition the one remaining vertical flask;
e build a shielded separation, segregation and packing station that interfaces with the
flask — a new, enhanced View Cell;
e use the flask to remove all vertical rigs;
e coarse-segregate rig components, attempting to separate out long-lived ILW,
e install additional, reusable shielding and containment to extend the reactor
biological shielding boundary;
e use Mobile Filtration Units to provide local exhaust ventilation;
e use Modular Containment Systems to supplement containment envelopes;
e use COTS remotely-controlled mobile machines as the major manipulative
equipment for decommissioning;
e use COTS cutting equipment for size-reduction and segregation;
e minimise the need for tooling development programmes;
e always trial an operation and train staff before active working, in a proof of principle
test area;
e penetrate the bulk biological shielding from the side and directly access the reactor
components, possibly using the horizontal beam holes as breakthrough points;
e extract horizontal rigs as they become accessible during reactor dismantling;
e size reduce in situ and remove the structural materials in the reactor and the
reactor aluminium tank, possibly including the above-RAT plugs and plates;
e remove inner annular layers of Barytes biological shielding that are ILW and LLW,;
e use 2m shielded boxes and perhaps shielded third height ISO containers for dense
and heavy ILW, rather than 4 m boxes;
e ship ILW and LLW containers ungrouted.

The plan submitted to the NDA has been refined, year-on-year. An additional push to quicken the
programme in 2006 required MTR decommissioning to be complete by December 2016. This was
possible provided Front End Decommissioning Engineering, optioneering and Regulatory engage-
ment started in April 2007. Revised Site funding limits have resulted in delays to this programme.
The current programme now shows MTR decommissioning starting some 14 years later.

Long Term Care and Surveillance
The Harwell MTRs are in the phase of Surveillance and Maintenance (S&M). They are in a safe
and secure state where the radioactive material is managed and the containment envelopes are
maintained to ensure that there is no degradation. This does not mean that there is no change,
from year to year. The ventilation system that was installed in 1995 keeps humidity and
temperature conditions inside the Containment Shells at levels where corrosion within the reactor
and rigs will not occur. This system also continually purges the reactors of any evolved tritium
which is measured and discharged through a registered point, meeting our Environmental
Discharge Authorisation conditions.
The ventilation controllers are several years beyond support from the supplier and will be replaced
this year with functionally similar PLCs. Other S&M activities include replacing old refrigerants,
carrying out structural surveys within the biological shielding and to the fabric of the Shells.
Progressive reduction of loose contamination, removal of asbestos and replacement of VIR-
insulated wiring continue. Documentation, plant and decommissioning records are being reviewed
so that an integrated, consistent approach to nuclear knowledge management for the Harwell
Reactors is achieved, that will last the decades before future decommissioning teams re-form.
