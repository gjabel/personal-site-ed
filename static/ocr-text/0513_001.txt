Synopsis
Early in 1997, one of the largest active buildings on UKAEA’s Harwell site was demolished.
The seven storey Chemical Engineering Building housed experimental and production-scale
equipment used to explore all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle, from fuel fabrication and zero

energy reactors to reprocessing, high level liquid waste vitrification and decommissioning. In
1991, nearly 200 separate areas designated under the IRRs contained a variety of chemically
and radiologically contaminated equipment and facilities. Since then all hazards have been
removed from the building under a planned and carefully managed decommissioning and
demolition programme. Seven examples from the programme are described.
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
In 1946 the teams at Harwell and Chalk River decided that a large building was required to
house plant and equipment for a new chemical engineering group working on the separation
of nuclear materials. The initial design of Harwell’s Building 351 was for a heavily shielded
facility that would routinely contain fissile material. The pressure to build production
facilities lead to this design evolving into B204 (at Windscale). The redesigned B351 became
a more versatile building with a tall, open, galleried hall allowing large pre-fabricated
concrete cells to be built and interconnected through pipe-work laid in floor ducts. Columns
rising from the cells could be accessed at different levels from the galleries for sampling,
related experiments and processing. At one side of the building was a long covered Storage
Pit containing high, medium and low active liquid effluent tanks (Figure 1). External delay
tanks held up liquid waste before it was pumped to site active drains. A two-storey Analytical
Laboratory supported the work programmes. The main curtain wall that ran down one side of
the building was heavily glazed so that it might act as a large bursting disc - relieving pressure
loadings from possible rig explosions that could damage the building structure. The building
covered an area of 115 metres by 50 metres and was seven storeys tall.
C539/027 169

During construction, it was clear that large-scale active separation experiments would have to
be carried out at Windscale, on the production facilities. Building 351’s mission evolved
from that of a dedicated pre-production separation test bed to an experimental facility with a
brief to explore all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle from fuel fabrication and zero energy
reactors to reprocessing, high level liquid waste vitrification and eventually decommissioning.
1.2. Old experiments
In the early 1950s solvent extraction of natural uranium and thorium was investigated.
Thorium blanket rods from the Windscale Piles were de-canned and chopped in a plant
submerged in two 12,000 gallon water-filled tanks located in the east end of the Storage Pit.
The ?°U product extracted in Pilot Plant No 6 was used to produce light and heavy water
solutions for criticality investigations in the homogencous aqueous zero energy thermal
reactors ZETR and HAZEL, also housed in Building 351. The *°U was recovered from the
heavy water and was transported to other sites for further research into these types of reactor.
Elsewhere in the building, high temperature experiments took place with the melting of
fission product material in a suite of lead cells known as Hotspur and with early attempts to
form small uranium spheres in a rudimentary shot tower. In the 1960s work on blending and
vacuum packing uranium dioxide and thorium oxide powders supported the fuel preparation
programme for Advanced Gas Cooled Reactors. Thoria slurries were routinely handled in
rigs on several of the extended gallery floors. In the late 1960s and early 1970s,
uranium/thorium mixed oxide and 20% enriched 3517 oxide spheres were produced for
conversion to nuclear fuel for PFR research. The success of the work lead to a production
plant being built in the old cubicles that had contained ZETR and HAZEL.
In 1991, all that remained of those experiments was contaminated cubicles, ventilation duct-
work and pipework, stocks of materials, and fixed contamination on walls, floors, steelwork,
old shielding concrete and lead blocks. Reliable records were not easy to find, Virtually all
of the staff who worked in Building 351 before 1965 had retired. Those that could be traced
had scant memory of the precise nature of the old operations since working and security
conditions had prevented staff from knowing details about projects even in adjacent areas.
1.3 Recent experiments
As the nuclear power programme matured, work in Building 351 changed. Research into
waste disposal focused on vitrification techniques beginning with the Fixation in Active Glass
of Active Liquors (FINGAL) experiments in the 1960s which used realistic active liquors
from Windscale. Later experiments investigated the problems posed by large scale batch and
continuous production of simulated vitrified waste using melters and rotary calciners,
Reprocessing was examined in large experimental dissolvers and key experiments on a high
temperature high pressure corrosion loop validated the design parameters of components for
the Prototype Fast Reactor. Sodium mass transfer rigs gave information to support UK and
international programmes on fast reactor technology. ,
The building structure has been modified many times since final commissioning in 1952. A
two storey extension was added in the Jate 1950s at the west end of the main building and
steel floor extensions to the galleries were added at every level. The Storage Pit area was
enclosed and active ventilation systems were rearranged to suit changing patterns of work.
Enclosures, temporary walls and partitions were used to compartmentalise areas, sometimes
acting as containments, in addition to the many cubicles, gloveboxes and fume cupboards.
170 C539/027

The last two decades saw a diversification away from the nuclear mission. Separation
technology was applied to chemical processing. Gel processing was used for pharmaceutical
production. Pilot plants were built for desalination and heat transfer research. Large scale
applications of microwave heating were investigated, including decontaminating concrete.
1.4 Commercial realities
In 1990 areas in Building 351 were managed by six of the nine UKAEA businesses created at
that time. The costs of working in a “nuclear” building did not sit easily with attempts to run
commercially viable non-nuclear R&D projects. As a result, equipment used in non-nuclear
work was moved to other buildings at Harwell. Funding for long term nuclear projects was
reducing rapidly. Attempts to find new uses for the building failed and in 1991, an Outline
Decommissioning Plan and review concluded that the most cost effective solution would be to
decommission the many rigs, laboratories and experimental areas as quickly as reasonably
practicable, leading to demolition of the building and a return to a green field site.
2s ‘THE DECOMMISSIONING PROGRAMME
The Plan contained estimates for labour needed to decommission every area of the building
and for quantities of waste that would be generated. These estimates were built into a strategy
for decommissioning which lead to a phasing of the work against the Department of Energy
(and later, Department of Trade and Industry) DRAWMOPS Programme Letter (now the Safe
Environmental Remediation (SAFER) programme). Basic parameters describing the building
are shown in Table 1.

The variable standard of building housekeeping and stockpiling of redundant material and
apparatus meant that each area undergoing decommissioning had to be carefully analysed for
potential hazards. Different approaches had been taken to mothballing old experiments and
labs, ranging from a well documented status following successful post operational clean out to
near abandonment. Areas that were still operational in 1991 were well managed with
substantial safety documentation. The decommissioning project and safety management team
remained the same from 1991 until 1997 which ensured continuity of approach and a
thorough understanding of the building characteristics and hazards‘, Initially the
decommissioning was carried out by dedicated UKAEA teams managed directly by the
project team, but by mid-1993 competitive tendering was applied to individual packets of
work. During the seven year period of decommissioning many standard techniques were
developed to cope with large scale operations. Seven examples of the decommissioning and
demolition programme are included in this paper.

3. BUILDING CLEARANCE
Because of the uncertainty surrounding the history of the building and the surrounding areas,
preparations for decommissioning and clearance always involved preliminary radiological
surveys, service isolations and where necessary, further COSHH and safety assessments, A
dedicated Housekeeping team of two Decommissioning Technicians and two Health Physics
Surveyors was used to reduce the hazards in each area by clearing the free-standing equipment
and materials (Figure 2), and by safely disconnecting and isolating the process services (air,
steam, gas, water etc.). These preliminaries were always managed directly by the UKAEA
Project Team, with specific Permits to Work and agreed method statements. The use of
dedicated staff with knowledge of the building for isolation (especially electrical) proved to be
one of the most important factors in the management of safety and adequately compensated
for any lack of records. Work on individual areas was often split into discrete stages to
manage risk, minimize uncertainty and hence reduce the total costs of competitive tenders.
a Analytical Laboratory decommissioning
Post operational clean out of the Analytical Laboratory complex was performed by the last
occupants. Moving equipment allowed access to a contaminated void store which had been
inaccessible for at least twenty five years The Labs originally contained thirty two built-in
fume cupboards with their own dedicated active extract system which ran up to the main
building Sixth Floor Plant Room. In about 1957 the Labs were refurbished, half the fume-
cupboards were removed and the active extract was relocated to the plant room directly above.
Initial clearance involved isolating and removing old electrical supplies (severely embrittled
rubber-insulated cables) and removing lab furniture, benches and shelves. Hidden behind the
benches was contaminated ductwork that ran into vertical wall voids. The ductwork was
sampled and found to contain low levels of loose '*’Cs contamination. Old photographs
showed the Lab with suites of gloveboxes which must have been removed during the
refurbishment, ventilated through the ductwork that was left behind.

Table 2 shows the main steps associated with the clearance and decommissioning of the
Analytical Laboratories. Work was completed in 12 weeks. The entire wing was designated a
controlled area and handed over to the contractor. The ductwork was wrapped and stored for
later size reduction in the building. Fume-cupboard steelwork went to landfill as chemically-
contaminated waste or as low level waste via the building HISO route (see below). Floors and
walls were scabbled and scarified to remove areas of fixed contamination. Asbestos
‘nsulation was removed from roof and pipe voids under controlled conditions.

3.2 Mild Steel Loop ;
The Mild Steel Loop was a non-radiological, complex steam/water test facility used to
measure corrosion at high temperatures and pressures. Operating records were not clear
regarding the possible presence of kilogram quantities of sodium in a number of test sections.
The test sections were safely isolated from the main loop which was dismantled using
hydraulic shears to cut the steel pipework into manageable pieces. Radiological monitoring
and sampling confirmed the absence of radioactivity and the steel was recycled. The sodium
test sections were removed and sentenced to an authorised disposal service with the expertise
to handle sodium wastes.

4, FINGAL - AN ABANDONED VITRIFICATION CELL

The FINGAL Cell housed a pilot scale vitrification plant which had processed approximately
20 TBq of fission product activity during the early 1960’s. The processing equipment (liquor
storage tanks, vitrification furnace, annealing ovens, off-gas filters etc.) was enclosed within a
lead cell, surrounded by massive concrete shielding. After work stopped in the mid-1960s,
the FINGAL Cell had been sealed off and left. Decommissioning was accomplished in three
phases: removal of the vitrification plant; removal and decontamination of the massive (20
tonne) concrete roof blocks; removal and decontamination of the concrete wall blocks.
Inspections and surveys were carried out using remotely deployed miniature CCTV cameras
and telescopic radiation probes. Access to the cell was via a narrow labyrinthine corridor.

A ventilated modular containment system (MCS) was sealed to the cell entrance to provide a
working area, avoiding the need to size reduce plant items within the restricted confines of the
main cell. The narrow cell entrance meant that any large equipment required to support the
decommissioning work could only be taken into the cell in pieces. For example, a proprietary
electric stacker truck was modified” to enable suited operators to reassemble and operate it to
dismantle the lead cell (constructed from 150kg blocks). A half-height ISO (HISO) container
loading facility was installed adjacent to the MCS (Figure 3). This permitted bulk items to be
dispatched as low level radioactive waste (LLW), without unnecessary size reduction.

The removal of the roof and wall blocks was conducted in a containment due to the presence
of '27Cs contamination. Extensive decontamination (using standard scabbling techniques),
core sampling and radiochemical analysis rendered the blocks suitable for unrestricted reuse.
All operations inside the MCS and FINGAL cell were monitored using CCTV. A two-way
audio link ensured that supervisors could help and advise operators during complex tasks.

5. MARK I GEL PRECIPITATION LABORATORY AND PLANT

The Mark 1 Gel Precipitation Plant was used to prepare U/Th spheres for fuel fabrication
studies and had been moth-balled when experimental programmes finished in the 1980’s. The
gel process used solutions of U/Th nitrates (in strong nitric acid), organic solvents and
ammonia. Residues remained in the moth-balled plant and its storage/preparation facilities.
Correct choice of PPE was crucial in ensuring operator safety. Concentrations of organic
solvents, ammonia and radioactivity in air were monitored continuously. Removal of gel
plant, feed solution preparation equipment and ammonia storage tank were phased to avoid
potentially hazardous interactions. Work was completed in 16 weeks.

C539/027 173

The Gel Precipitation Laboratory floor and walls were also contaminated. The floor was

essentially a 6mm thick steel "catch-tray" pinned into the concrete beneath. The radiological

status of the concrete was unknown. The wall dividing the laboratory from the main building
was four storeys tall with contamination within the cavity. Both the wall and floor were
removed as part of the decontamination of the laboratory over a period of 20 weeks.

6. SEPP AND THE URANIUM EVAPORATOR

The solvent extraction pilot plant (SEPP) was used to investigate the recovery of uranium

during fuel reprocessing. The plant consisted of:

e Cubicle 1 — constructed of plastic cladding bolted to a steel framework, enclosing 80m’,
running from the ground to the 5 Floor. It housed 12m tall extraction columns (ranging
in size from 25mm to 125mm diameter) and a boiler unit, located on the 3" Floor;

e Cubicle 2 — was located on the 1° Floor and it contained the mixer settler plant and a
series of liquor storage vessels of up to 300 litres capacity;

e Evaporator Plant — both cubicles were connected to an evaporator plant which was
located in the Storage Pit. The evaporator was used to concentrate urany] nitrate
solutions for recycle to the extraction plant. The main (2m’) liquor storage vessels were
also located in the Pit.

Plant decommissioning was straightforward but was dominated by the potential for falls

through the open floor areas within Cubicle 1. Strict controls were necessary to prevent

operators working directly below the dismantling work and CCTV was used to check
progress. Approximately 3m°> solvent (20% tributyl phosphate in odourless kerosene)
contaminated with low levels of uranium activity was left from plant operations, stored in two
steel tanks in the Pit. There was no disposal route for this material without the removal of the
radioactivity. An ion-exchange material and process were developed to treat the solvent.

This was successful and the 3m? of cleaned solvent was sent for incineration at a licensed

disposal site. The ion-exchange material was grouted and sent to Drigg as LLW.

7, CDFR DISSOLVER

The CDER dissolver was installed to study the dissolution of spent fast reactor breeder fuel.

Experiments were conducted on 200-300kg of unirradiated pins containing depleted UO).

The dissolver was housed within a large 100? ventilated cubicle which extended over two

floors. The cubicle also contained off-gas treatment equipment (condensers, NO, scrubbers,

demisters etc) and the large liquor storage vessels (concentrated HNO;, NaOH, uranyl nitrate).

Limited post operational clean out had been completed by the previous operators. However,

significant volumes of liquors remained within the plant. These were recovered, analysed,

conditioned and sent to the appropriate disposal route (chemical waste/radioactive effluent).

The cubicle was then adapted to provide the containment for plant decommissioning. The

solubility of the contamination greatly assisted decontamination and a significant proportion
of the material recovered was demonstrated to be radiologically clean. Plasma cutting
techniques were used to size reduce the main dissolver in-situ. Local, high volume,
ventilation/filtration systems maintained aerosols within the cubicle at acceptable levels. The
final phase was to dismantle the cubicle and the large volume liquor catch-trays.

8. MAIN ACTIVE VENTILATION SYSTEMS ;

Building 351 was served by a number of extract systems installed for the removal of
potentially contaminated air. The extract fans and filter systems were located on the 6" floor.
The fume-cupboards, active plant and decontamination facilities were connected to the fans
by approximately 4km of mild steel ducting (sizes up to 3m x 3m). The possible presence of
radioactive contamination within the ducting resulted in the need to undertake the dismantling
operations within specially erected scaffold/PVC enclosures. This was particularly important
where a number of suspect contaminated ducts were routed outside of the building. Lifting
aids enabled the PVC-wrapped ducting to be safely lowered to floor and ground levels.

A specially designed size reduction facility was set-up to process the ducting and other
components. Decontamination was always used where it was proven to be ALARP. The
ducting which could not be decontaminated was size reduced using cold cutting techniques
(nibblers, band saws, etc) to produce “flat packs” of wrapped waste for disposal in HISO
containers as LLW. This approach reduced waste disposal costs by a factor of 50.

9, BUILDING DEMOLITION

The strategy for decontamination and demolition of the building structure was to use
conventional methods wherever possible. The demolition of the two storey West Wing
extension was used as a trial for the main building and was completed in August 1996. This
provided valuable information regarding the overall approach, but more importantly it
finalised the methodology for radiological clearance surveys. For example, it highlighted the
need to remove the metal floor plates to fully expose the floor support structures and proved
the success of using “cherry pickers” to access high level surfaces. Long range surveillance,
remotely steered, CCTV was tested and became an important tool in management control.

An environmental impact assessment was conducted prior the demolition of the main
building. Dust and noise were highlighted as potential problems as Building 351 was adjacent
to the site boundary fence and the main NRPB and MRC buildings. Its closest neighbour on
the Harwell site was the main post irradiation examination facility. Vibration controls were
therefore necessary to protect that building’s zinc bromide-filled cell windows.

The project management team moved from the main building in March 1997. Contractors
and project temporary offices were placed close to the building and the site was fenced in.
Four CCTV cameras were fixed to towers at the periphery of the building and local and
remote monitors were installed. Control of all the cameras and video recording was done at
the main project office which was within sight of the main building. Demolition commenced
in April 1997 with the demolition of the Office and Analytical Wings. The asbestos/cement
cladding panels were removed from the main building by carefully cropping the retaining
bolts and lowering the panels to ground level for disposal to an authorised landfill.

Demolition of the main steel/concrete superstructure proceeded by collapsing the roof and
gallery floors using a wrecking ball suspended from a crane, and cutting the main steel
supports as they were exposed. Continuous environmental monitoring and radiological
surveys provided reassurance throughout. All demolition work was completed in August
1997 but the concrete base-mat and below ground storage facilities remain on Care and
Maintenance.

10. WASTE MANAGEMENT :
Rigorous radiological monitoring and sampling ensured that the wastes generated were
correctly segregated. Decontamination techniques were employed to minimise the volume of
radioactive material dispatched to the Harwell Radwaste Service (HRS). The application of
these techniques was always judged on safety (ALARP) and economic grounds. The
radiological fingerprint of the waste from individual tasks was determined prior to
decommissioning and measurements that were made included gross activity, with B analysis
and o and y- spectrometry to identify the isotopes present. This data was then used to ensure
that LLW disposals complied with the requirements for material dispatched to Drigg.
Any compactable waste, such as barrier waste (coveralls, gloves, overshoes etc), was
sentenced to 200 litre bins for super-compaction. To ensure cost-effective HISO container
filling, size reduction was employed to improve packing factors, and the wastes from different
tasks were blended to minimise the voidage within the HISO container. Waste management
procedures were subject to rigorous audit and monitoring.
Approximately | tonne of nuclear material (uranium and thorium) was dispatched to HRS as
contact handled ILW. This material was originally used in the Gel Precipitation and
Dissolver programmes and had to be re-packaged into standard 50 and 100 litre waste bins
and 50 litre carboys for disposal. LLW and ILW volumes dispatched to HRS are summarised
in Table 3. The 1991 Outline Plan estimate for LLW anticipated improved decontamination
processes from scaled-up R&D that did not materialize. Nevertheless predictions were
adequate for planning.

All unidentified chemicals were analysed prior to their disposal. Many thousands of analyses
were carried out on substances ranging from small (~ 5 ml) to large (tonne) bulk quantities.
Chemical waste was sentenced through the Hazardous Disposal Service of AEA Technology.
The disposal arrangements operated by this service were subject to regular UKAEA audit to
ensure the maintenance of Duty of Care.
Non-hazardous waste was dispatched (after monitoring by Health Physics) in skips for land-
fill or on trailers for possible re-use or sale as scrap. Many tonnes of redundant copper cable
was recovered and sold. The proceeds from the sale of the main steel support structures were

set against the costs of the demolition of the building superstructure. The bulk of the concrete
and brick rubble from the superstructure was crushed and used as in-fill on the Harwell site.
11, CONCLUSIONS
The demolition of a contaminated seven storey building was completed successfully, to plan
and within budget. Despite the lack of documentation and operational records from the early
experimental programmes, safe decommissioning of large, complicated, contaminated
facilities within the building complex was possible because all operations were carefully
planned and managed by the resident UKAEA project management team. The continuity of
the project management team membership ensured that the decommissioning work was to a
consistent standard and that there was a common approach to the use of contractors.
The management and control of contracting and working methods ensured that the project was
completed within the budget profile and predicted timescales.
An early decision was made to process LLW within the building using a dedicated HISO
container facility, rather than using 200 litre drums. This solution was initially driven by the
practicalities of dealing with waste from FINGAL decommissioning but produced significant
cost advantages both in volume cost and less need for size reduction. The processing of the
building’s active extract ventilation ductwork in a containment close to the HISO facility
minimised risk of contamination migration and reduced the complexity of waste movements.
| All tasks were subject to rigorous safety assessments and were controlled by Method
Statements and the Permit to Work system. This ensured that those at the working level were
fully aware of specific hazards and had immediate access to the documentation that defined
the task execution. All contractors underwent site induction and building specific training.
There were no serious incidents or accidents.
Where areas could not be easily observed, cctv systems provided more information and
improved levels of confidence. Cameras were used for plant inspection where human access
was difficult or impossible. Installed surveillance systems inside containments gave
supervisors and UKAEA managers direct views of work in progress and controllable
overview cameras inside and outside the building were used to observe progress safely from a
distance.
The techniques developed and used in this project and the lessons learnt have been applied to
other UKAEA decommissioning projects and operational work with equal success.
