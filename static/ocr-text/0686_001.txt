An Electric Power Transfer System
This invention relates to a system for transferring
electric power from an electric source to an electrical
device which is movable relative to the source.

5 Two known techniques for transferring electric power
from a stationary source to a movable electric device,
involve either the use of flexible cable links, or the use
of brushes making contact with conductor rails. Cables may

, suffer fatigue due to repeated flexing, or encounter
10 obstructions in use, and brushes may cause sparking and
- become contaminated with particulate material, thus making
reliable electrical contact difficult.

According to the present invention, a power transfer
system comprises transformer means comprising: a first

15 magnetic core portion defining at least two Spaced-apart
regions thereof which extend in a direction along: which
power supply is to be provided; a first winding wound
“around the first core portion; a second magnetic core
portion of limited extent in the said direction, providing

20 a low reluctance flux path between the spaced-apart regions
of the first core portion so as to complete a magnetic flux
circuit therewith, and being movable relative to the first
core portion along the said direction; and a second winding
wound around the second core portion; wherein an auxiliary

25 primary winding is wound around the first core portion
remote from the first winding.

The regions which extend in the direction along which
power is to be supplied might extend in a straight line, or
in a curved or circular manner, The system may be adapted

30 for polyphase operation.

The invention will now be further described by way of

. -2-
example only with reference to the accompanying drawings in
which:-
Figures 1 and 2 show perspective representations of
single phase electric power transfer systems;
5 Figures 3 and 4 show perspective representations of
three-phase electric power transfer systems;
Figure 5 shows a plan view of a modification of the
system of Figure 4; and
Figure 5a shows a sectional view along the line Va - :
10 Va of Figure 5,
In the above Figures, like parts have like numerals.
Referring now to Figure l, a single phase power
. ’ transfer system comprises primary windings 10 wound onto a
magnetic core. portion 12 formed from straight, elongate
15 laminated iron bars 14 extending parallel to and adjacent
to each other and linked at each end by short laminated
iron bars 16. (Note: Short lines drawn on the bars 14 and
16 represent the direction of the laminations). An
auxiliary primary winding 18 is provided at the end of the
20 core portion 12 furthest from the primary windings 10 and a
secondary winding 20 is wound onto a laminated iron member
22 which extends between the bars 14 and is movable in a ;
direction parallel to the bars 14 as shown by the arrows, .
the member 22 providing a low reluctance magnetic path
25 between the regions of the magnetic core portion 12 defined
by the bars 14,
When the primary windings 10 are connected to a source
(not shown) of alternating current with a frequency of for

wo 3m
example 50 Hz, an alternating magnetic flux passes through
the magnetic core portion 12 and also through the low
reluctance magnetic path provided by the member 22. An
alternating electromotive force (e.m.f.) will therefore be
5 induced in the secondary windings 20, and may be used to
provide electric power to an electrical device (not shown).
. Some magnetic flux leakage from the bars 14 can be
expected. Hence if the member 22 is far from the primary
windings 10, it may be necessary to augment the flux from
10 the primary windings 10 by energising the auxiliary primary
, winding 18. The problems due to magnetic leakage become
more significant the longer the bars 14, and one solution
, is to provide a C-shaped laminated iron core 25
magnetically linking the bars 14 and onto which an
15 additional primary winding 27 is wound. It should be
possible to have a multiplicity of such C-cores 25 along
the length of the power transfer system, and if necessary
the local additional primary windings 27 could be switched
in as the member 22 approached. If required, the member 22
20 could be turned about its longitudinal axis.
: An alternative system (not shown) similar to that of
Figure 1, has the secondary winding 20 wound onto the
C-core 25 which is made movable along the long bars 14, and
if necessary has additional primary windings 18 wound on
25 Static members 22,

In Figure 2 is a slightly different single phase power
| transfer system from that of Figure 1, the main difference
: being in the plane of the laminations which are indicated

in the same manner as in Figure 1. The system comprises
30 primary windings 10 (all the windings being represented by
broken lines) wound onto a laminated end portion 30. Two
straight, elongate laminated iron bars 14 extend from the
end portion 30, and:‘at their far end are linked by another

=
end portion 30 onto which an auxiliary primary winding 18
may be wound. A secondary winding 20 is wound onto a
C-shaped laminated iron core 32 which makes wiping contact
along the sides of the bars 14,

5 The power transfer system of Figure 2 operates ina

Similar manner to that of Figure 1, the C-core 32 providing
a low reluctance flux path between the bars 14. If it is
found necessary to augment the magnetic flux from the
primary windings 10, this may be done by energising the

10 auxiliary primary winding 18, or by energising additional :
primary windings (not shown) wound on C-shaped laminated
iron cores (not shown) similar to the C-core 32 but fixed °
to the bars 14 on the other side to that of the C-core 32.

A three-phase power transfer system may be arranged as

15 in Figure 3 utilising three magnetic core portions 12 of
Figure 1, three primary windings 10 and, if required, three
auxiliary primary windings 18 (only two are shown). Three
secondary windings 20 (only two are shown) are wound onto a
‘Laminated iron E-shaped core 34, the E-core 34 being

20 slidable along the magnetic core portions 12.

If required, additional primary windings 27 may be
wound on fixed laminated iron E-shaped cores 36 linking the
magnetic core portions 12 and spaced along their length on
the opposite side to that of the slidable E-core 34,

25 In Figure 4 is shown a simpler design of three-phase
power transfer system comprising three elongate bars 14
linked at each end by laminated iron E~shaped cores 38, On
one E-core 38 three primary windings 10 are wound, and
three auxiliary primary windings 18 are wound on the other

30 E-core 38. Three secondary windings 20 are wound on a
laminated iron E-shaped core 34 which is slidable along the
top side of the bars 14.

-5-

The elongate bars 14 may be 50mm thick, 75mm wide and
2m long. If a longer power transfer system is required,
the design of Figure 4 may be modified as shown in Figures
5 and 5a by laying the bars 14 end to end to the required

5 length, primary windings 10 being wound onto an E-shaped
core 38 at one end of the system and additional primary
windings 27 being wound onto E=-shaped cores 36 on the
underside of the bars 14, The E-cores 36 are situated on
either side of every butt joint between adjacent bars 14.

10 As in the system of Figure 4, secondary windings 20 are

" wound on an E-shaped core 34 which is slidable along the
upper side of the bars 14. Only the primary windings 10 or

g additional primary windings 27 in the vicinity of the
E-core 34 need be energised. Sequential energising of the

15 additional primary windings 27 produces the effect of a
magnetic commutator.

In the power transfer systems described with reference
to Figures 1 to 5, straight bars 14 are used to define
regions of the stationary magnetic core portions. In these

20 systems, the path along which the secondary windings 20
move and along which electrical power is available is a
straight line. It will be understood that where electrical
power must be supplied along a curved path, the elongate
bars 14 may themselves be curved. Alternatively, elongate

25 bars 14 may be laid end to end, as in the system of Figure
5, but so as to define a generally curved path. In each
case, the two or more regions of the stationary core .
portion 12 must be separated by a constant distance along

| their length.

, 30 Operation of the power transfer system at higher
frequencies, for examples 5kHz, enables smaller cores to be
used to transmit the same power and increases the efficiency
of the system. In addition, cores may be made of a ferrite
or iron powder, rather than laminated iron.

-6-
‘ If desired, the high frequency e.m.f. induced in the
secondary windings may be subsequently converted to 50 or
60 Hertz using for example a controlled rectifier and a
direct current link inverter.

5 In order to reduce the air gap between the magnetic
core portions, a magnetic liquid such as Ferrofluid may be
introduced between the portions. However, when the power
transfer system is de-energised, an auxiliary low power
electric supply may be necessary to provide sufficient ;

10 residual magnetism in the core portions to retain the
Perrofluid.

In some applications of the invention a relatively
thin non-magnetic material may be interposed between the
first core portion and the second core portion, for example

15 the wall of a tank enclosing a radioactive environment.
