Laboratory
After reviewing robotics technology and its possible application in nuclear remote handling systems
of the future, six main research topics were identified where particular effort should be made.
The Harwell Nuclear Robotics Programme is currently establishing sets of demonstration hardware
which will allow generic research to be carried out on telerobotics, systems integration, the man
machine interface, communications, servo systems and radiation tolerance. The objectives of the
demonstrators are to allow validation of the techniques required for successful active facility
applications such as decommissioning, decontamination, refurbishment, maintenance and repair, and
to act as training aids to encourage plant designers and operators to adopt developments in new
technology.
