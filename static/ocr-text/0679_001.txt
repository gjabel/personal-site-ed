A study of the Power Consumption
of German Maglev Passenger Vehicles
(EDS and EMS)

SUMMARY

The sample revenue vehicle designs of the two German Maglev groups
have been analysed and the complex power requirement at trackside substations
has been calculated,

The two systems are the Electromagnetic system (EMS) with either linear
induction motor (LIM) or long stator motor propulsion, and the Electro-
dynamic System (EDS) with linear synchronous motor (LSM) propulsion.

The operational conditions considered were 400 and 500 km/h velocities
either at a steady-state cruise or with a grade or headwind additional
loading.

It is found that the LSM of the EDS is the most suitable form of
propulsion for these operating conditions, the long stator motor for the
EMS having reasonable characteristics at 400 km/h, but becoming degraded at
500 km/h, and the LIMs studied being unsuited to 500 km/h, and not very
good even at 400 km/h.

These results highlight the need in a system comparison to not
merely compare specific power or lift to drag ratio, which denote the
active power supplied to a vehicle, but to compare complex power at )
wayside substations to indicate the overall efficiencies and power factors
of the competing system.

A Study of the Power Consumption of German Passenger Vehicles (EDS and EMS )
1. Background and reason for study

The two German Maglev groups have prepared sample designs for passenger
and goods carrying vehicles. However, although vehicle details are
relatively easy to find in the literature, vehicle performance, and general
operating power consumption data are not so forthcoming.

A recent publication (1) quotes figures of power consumption for the
comparative German designs which are misleading, because, as the author
correctly states, the EDS (Electrodynamic system) and EMS (Electromagnetic
system) long and short stator cannot be directly compared,

Of particular damage to the EDS désign is the section 4-2 in the Table
which compares power supply requirements of the substations, in real power
rating. ‘

(a) EMS short stator 5SMW/vehicle at 400 km/h

D.C. substation every 12 km, 4 kV distributio

(b) EMS long stator 4.7 Mil/vehicle at 400 km/h

nee ° Substations every 12 km, with pulse
inverters and isolators feeding a
travelling field machine.
Frequency 0-200 Hz.

(c) EDS long stator 12.5 MW/vehicle at 500 km/h

Substations every 15 km, with pulse
inverters and isolators feeding a travelling
field machine.
Frequency 0-50 Hz.

A literal conclusion from these figures could be that the EDS is
particularly wasteful in real power consumption, needing two and a half times

as much real power as the other two systems. This is not a valid conclusion
and the following major differences in design should be observed:

(a) The cruise speeds are different

(b) - The vehicle weights are different

(c) The passenger capacities are different

(d) The EDS system has railway bogies

(e) Overall power factor - efficiency product is not included

(i.e. no indication of system total MVA requirement)
-J]-

Sone comparisons can be made for speed extrapolations from the
base designs. The "Konstanz 1977 Statusseminar VI"(2) gives sufficient
detail for the active power requirements to be estimated, but there is
little clear information on power factor and efficiency of the short
and long stator motor EMS designs.

Vehicle weight differences in the designs will effect the specific
power of the levitation system (kW/tonne). In particular, the choice
of railway type bogies on the EDS vehicle for low speed guidance and
Support must impose a greater weight penalty than, for example, the
Canadian Maglev Revenue Vehicle wheel sets. (The wheelset weight is
only 4% of all-up weight in the CIGGT design).

Passenger capacity is the least important difference, with respect
to power requirement, since the pay load is a small proportion of
the vehicle total weight.
viz. EMS short stator 240 passengers, 24t on 170t, 14.1%

EMS Tong stator 240 passengers, 24t on 165t, 14.5%
EDS "  " 200 passengers, 20t on 130t, 1544%

_ An increase af 40 passengers on the EDS system gives a weight
increase of 4 tonnes, or 3%, so this would have about the same effect
on propulsion power requirements, but the overall effect on specific
energy consumption (kW-h/passenger-km) would be a reduction of about
15% (i.e. quite marked),

Because of the different characteristics of the three systems,
they will be analysed individually.

2. Electrodynamic system (EDS) of Levitation.
2.1 Vehicle concept.

The vehicle is made up of two similar end sections. A five section

train can be made by intvoducing three middle sections with their own
lift, guidance and propulsion. Passenger seating is 100 per section. .

The lift is provided by ten superconducting magnets, and the
guidance and propulsion by fifteen magnets, per section.

The main vehicle characteristics are from Chapter P "Application
Investigation and Project Design, Description and Explanation of the EDS
Concept", by K. Mandt (2) and are reproduced in Table 1. Figure 1 shows

2.2 Drag figures at 500 km/h
From reference (2) the values of magnetic drag and aerodynamic
drag at 140 m/s (500 km/h) are displayed graphically as 41.7 KN and
47.5 kN respectively. The steady state drag on the vehicle is therefore
89.2 kN or 12.5 MW.
Although the level of residual acceleration needed to overcome
head-on gusting and gradients is not quoted for the EDS system, a figure
of 0.013g will be taken, as this is used in the EMS studies.

2.3 Drag figures at 400 km/h
The aerodynamic drag at 490 km/h can be obtained by interpolation
of graphical data (28 kN), or by observing that aerodrag is proportional
to (velocity)?, (3).

Aerodrag @ 400 km/h = Aerodrag @ 500 km/h x (Ut) = 29.9 kN
Magnetic drag power from a graph is 4.9 Mu, which corresponds
to a drag force of 44,1 kN,

2.4 Power Factor and Efficiency
Sreesanth Siesta CI ENG
The LSM is capable of operating at high power factor and
efficiency. However the choice of power factor depends largely on
the superconducting coil design, and the leakage inductance in the
track winding. Similarly, the efficiency is determined by the
transferred power required, and the track winding cross-section.
Both parameters are obtained by a machine design which takes into
account the energy used, and the capital costs of the system, and
trades the two against each other.
2.4.1 Power factor and efficiency at 500 km/h
ep nat ianenseestenseprnte any aman ;
Albrecht gives a power-factor-efficiency product of 2/3,(4), for
a 120 tonne two section vehicle, with 87 kN thrust at 500 km/h. The
machine output power was 12 MU, and total input power 18 MVA.
The Statusseminar values differ only slightly, being presented
, as fractions of the number of sections in the train, and the track
wound sectional area.
-4-

Typically, they are n = 0.75 product = 0.66

cose = 0,88
So for a steady state, on the level cruise at 500 km/h, the machine
input power is 16.7 MN, and total input power is 18.9 MVA.

For operation with full residual acceleration, the power factor
and efficiency have to be re-evaluated. Since the motor thrust is
proportional to armature current (and is also speed independent),
and since the track losses are proportional to (armature current)?,
then

Track losses for 106.4 kN thrust = losses for s.s. 89.2 kN
2
thrust x (108.5)
8922
= 4.2 x 1.42 = 6.0 MW
i.e. an input power of 14.9 + 6.0 = 20.9 MW,
and an efficiency of 1.9 5 0.71.
20.9
For the LSM, if the airgap m.m.f. waves are in quadrature, the
= power factor can be expressed as a fun-tion of the efficiency and
reactance-resistance ratio, X/R.
cose = ——1____
X 3
(1 + Re (1-n)2)
rearranging, z = Hang.
l-n

Using the steady state of n = .75 and cose = .88, X/R = 2.16. For
residual acceleration operation, n = 0.71, so cosé@ = 0.85, and
total input power is 20.9 24.6 MVA.

; 2.4.2 Power factor and efficiency at 400 km/h.

- As with the last section, losses can be established at the
different thrust requirements, and the efficiency and machine active
power input found, Using the reactance-resistance ratio the power
factor can also be found. The losses at 400 km/h for steady state

oa ‘ and accelerating duty are 2.9 MW and 4.4 MW, that is 68.8% and 105% 7
of the loss for steady state duty at 500 km/h, respectively. The

efficiencies are hence 0.74 and 0.70, giving power factors of 0.91
and 0.89. Total input complex powers become 12.2 and 16.3 HVA.

2.5 Other power requirements
On board power requirements are met by a gas turbine set, The
gas turbine drives the Helium compressor and also a 400 Hz three
phase generator. Power js distributed throughout the vehicle on a
380 V, 400 Hz line. Albrecht quotes a figure of | MW for vehicle on
board power (4), and the Statusseminar gives 300 kl required for
the Helium compressor and 238 kW for other on board systems per
section. These are hydraulic and pneumatic power, heating, ventilation
for oil and gas heat exchangers, lighting, primary damping for list
and guidance, and at low Speeds, wheel synchronization.

. . 3. Common points for short and long stator EMS systems
3.1 Make-up of total power requirements
In establishing the tota] power used by a transportation system, i
ue the choice of specific power consumption in kWh/passenger-km only
highlights the real power consumed. However the plant and power
~6§-

converters are all rated in terms of total power used, and with
inductive magnetic energy transfer (linear induction motors) the
power factor and efficiency can have an extreme effect on calculations
based purely on real power transferred across the air gap. Energy
drawn from a supply utility will also be costed to take into account
the amount of reactive power used.

Generally, the total power flow is made up of the following
parts:

(a) Aerodynamic drag power is proportional to the cube of
velocity and the aerodynamic reference area for the vehicle.

i (b) Magnetic drag power is proportional to (velocity)3/2 and
is made up of both guidance and lift drag components. The exact

, value is highly dependent on gap size and magnet control and
suspension strategy.

(c) Cooling drag power is required to overcome the inlet
momentum drag associated with the cooling air for the on board-power
conditioning, magnets and motors.

(d) Residual acceleration power is the spare capacity for

| acceleration at cruise speed over inclines, headwinds, etc.

(e) Power losses within the on board systems.

(f) Acceleration power to reach cruise speed.

(g) Miscellaneous power demands. |

| (h) Distribution losses in trackside equipment downstream of
the substation.

(1) Reactive power loading is the total amount of power flowing
in quadrature to the active power, and is associated largely with the
leakage inductance in the supply network and the linear induction motor.

(j) The steady state drag power is the sum of (a), (b) and (c).

(k) The effective power is the sum of (j) and (d).

(1) The picked uppower is the sum of (k) and (e).

(m) The installed propulsive power is the sum of (1) and (f).

(n) The total active load is the sum of (m), (g) and (h).

(0) The total power flow is the vector sum of (n) and (i).

3.2 Power mix for previous EMS designs ‘

The literature is scarce of complete sets of figures for power

mixes of EMS vehicles. The two exceptions are Hebst (5) and Winkle (6).
_7-

Interpolation of Hebst's diagram for power flow gives the following
mix (based on magnitude of total active power load = 100).
Total reactive power load 200
Total active power load 100
Installed propulsive power 85
Power pick up 67
Effective power 42
S.S. drag power 33
The effective power is broken down as
Aero drag 48%,
Mag drag 20%
Cooling drag ~ 11%
Residual acceleration 21%
These figures are based on a 720,000 1b (327t) vehicle with three cars
and 300 passengers.
The overall power factor is '/Y5 (0.45), and the overall
efficiency is
n = 1] - tosses = 1 ~- (Power pick up - Effective power) _ 0.75
active power active power
The figures are inconsistent within the paper, but using the quoted
figure of 17.8 MW as the speed x total drag, total effective power
(assumed to be at steady state, on the level).
Aerodrag 61% 10.9 MW ,
Mag drag 25% 4.5 MW
Cooling drag 14% 2.4 MW
17.8 MW
i.e. the cooling drag is ~ 20% the magnitude of the aerodynamic drag,
, and 54% the magnitude of the magnetic drag.
Winkle quotes. the mix for the propulsion power as being (for a

ale

j.e. virtually identical with Hebst, even though the vehicle weight
has now changed to 270 tonnes.
Winkle also quotes an aerodynamic coefficient CF = 9.0 m4,
which corresponds to 68.2 kN or 7.6 MW at 400 km/h. His figures
for traction resistance and mechanical propulsion power (128 kN
and 14.2 MW) do not fit with the mix mentioned. 68.2 kN is 53.3% of
128 kN, so by changing the amount of residual acceleration, but keeping
the ratios of magnetic and cooling drags to aerodrag the same, the
mix would become
Aerodrag 53.3% 68.2 kN 7.6 MW
Mag drag 23.7% 30.3 kN 3.4 MW
Cooling drag 13.0% 16.7 KN 1.8 MW
Residual acceleration 10.0% 12.8 kN . 1.4 MM
128.0: kM 14.2 MW
Here the cooling drag is 24% the magnitude of the aerodynamic drag,
and 55% the magnitude of the magnetic drag.
Winkle suggest values of power factor and efficiency for both
the EMS designs. The total picked up active power for the EMS
short stator is quoted as 25.6 Ml, which suggests an efficiency of
On S55).
The long stator motor efficiency and power factor suggested
by Winkle is 0.8 and 0.72 respectively. Comparing this apparent
efficiency of 0.58 to the 0.3 of the short stator motor illustrates
that for every kW of drag supplied by the propulsion, the terminal
rating of the short stator machine would have to be roughly twice that
of the long stator equivalent.

It should be noted that a common aerodynamic coefficient is
used for the long and short stator designs. The short stator vehicle
has protruding brushgear, but this only affects the aerodynamic drag
by 5% (200 kW).

Extension of the two designs to 500 km/h and 300 km/h operation
was performed and the power division and weight breakdown were presented
graphically. No estimates were given for the power factor or efficiene y
of the designs.

Figures 4 and 5 show the distribution systems used for the
short and long stator propulsions. The main difference is the absence
of mechanical pickup for the long stator design. A linear generator

provides the power transfer to the on-board network. The difference ~
of weight of only 5 tonnes between EMS vehicles despite the lack of
massive on-board components for propulsion on the long stator vehicle
is caused by a larger magnet weight decided by a lower working current
density, and by an increased battery weight required to maintain slow
speed running.

: The short stator machine picks up power from a 4 kV d.c. rail,
whereas the long stator machine has the 12 km distance between substations
subdivided into about 8 subsections, through auxiliary thyristor switching
and tapping, to carry the variable frequency line power.

4. EMS short stator system.
‘ 4.1 Drag figures at 400 km/h

The power division of a short stator EMS vehicle (total weight
170 tonnes) is given in Chapter D of the Statusseminar (2). Knowing
the aerodynamic coefficient of 4.75 m2 gives an aerodrag power of
4.0 MW, the steady state propulsion power (6,6 MW) can be split down
into aerodrag and 2.6 MW of remaining power. Presumably the majority
of the 2.6 MW is cooling drag, but the text does not specifically refer
to it as such.

The power for lift and guidance comes to 0.5 MN or ~ 3 kW/tonne
vehicle weight. The lift specific power is ~ 2 kW/t. Residual

“acceleration propulsion power is the power surplus needed for the extra
-acceleration over gradients, at cruise speed.

Weidinger only gives the 500 km/h values of steady state and maximum |
power with respect to the maximum power at 400 km/h.
The steady state figure is 14.5 MW, maximum figure 18.2 MW, interpolated
from a graph.
Because of the increase in propulsive power required, two linear
induction motors (LIM) per section are necessary, and this increases
the all-up weight by 20% to 205 tonnes.

4.3 Power Factor and Efficiency

The statusseminar makes no attempt to display the power factor
or efficiency of the short stator machines. The product of the two,
i.e. the ratio of active power output to total complex power input,
is not likely to be high.

Winkle (6) quotes an efficiency of 0.6 and power factor of
0.5 (apparent efficiency = n cose = 0.3) and states that new calculations
suggest efficiencies ~ 0.78 and power factors of » .65, which brings
the apparent efficiency up to 0.51. It must be emphasized that these
are calculations and do not represent measurements on constructed machines.

Since the apparent efficiency is not known with any certainty at
400 km/h, predictions for 500 km/h must be questionable. Although it
might be argued that the "goodness" of the overall machine could be
expected to increase, in fact the design calls for two motors per
section, whose output rating will not change much from the 400 km/h
motor. (18.2 MM at 500 km/h, 9.9 MW at 400 km/h). Therefore the estimates
of input power will be made using the same power factor and efficiency

: used at 400 km/h.

4.4 Final Figures for short stator EMS

The total steady state and total effective drags are shown in Table
8. Note that the 500 km/h individual breakdown is from deduced values,
and the total drag figures are interpolated from a graph in reference (2).

The machine total active power input and total complex power input
are deduced from values of power factor and efficiency suggested by
reference (6). They are shown in Table 9.

No attempt has been made here to estimate increased losses in current
collection systems running at 500 km/h, if indeed this is possible for

‘ loads of 30 MW (see Section 6.1). An increased loss in the on-board
power convertor which has a 4 kV D.C. input and output to the double-
sided linear induction motors must also be expected, as well as in‘the
4 kV distribution system itself.

Weh's total for power output (Aerodynamic drag + on-board systems)
is 4.7 MW; this could be the source of Leonhard's figure for power
supply requirement.

It is difficult to know which figures to use, especially as the
cooling drag is unknown. For continuity with section 4, Weidinger's
figures will be used with the assumption that the distribution and
winding losses are the main system losses.

In common with the short stator design, a residual acceleration of
0.013g requires a power of 2.4 MW.

5.2 Drag figures at 500 km/h

As with the figures for the short stator vehicle, steady state
and maximum power with respect to the maximum power at 400 km/h are
plotted in reference (2). In addition a numerical value of 11.5 MW
is given in the text as the steady state 500 km/h power requirement. The
graphical value for maximum power at 500 km/h is 14.8 MW. The vehicle
weight is increased by 10%, to ~ 180 tonnes for the speed increase.

Scaling the 400 km/h values approximately, results in a difference
of 200 kW from the quoted 11.5 MW, s.s. power

| 9.3 Power factor and Efficiency

As with the short stator designs, the statusseminar does not
quantify the power factor or efficiency expected with the full size
vehicle design. However, Weh's figures for 800 kW winding loss and
800 kW distribution loss indicate an efficiency of

5 ly - losses _ 1 - 16 = .79.
input 6.1+1.6
For comparison, Winkle's figures are 0.8 for efficiency and 0.72
for power factor.

efficiency relationships from section 2.3.2,
cose = 1 : ‘ -tane . 4 59
X © (1 = 4)
(1 +7 (1 7 n)2)2 |
The corresponding reactance-resistance ratio at 500 km/h is 5.78,

As in Section 2.4, the losses can be scaled by the ratio of drag
forces, squared, to obtain loss at differing drag powers. The
efficiency can be computed, and power factor obtained using one of the
above formulae.

It should be noted that the equations used for power factor
estimation are suitable for an air cored armature, as in the L.S.M.
Inherent saturation and extra leakage in the EMS long stator armature
implies that the resulting power factors will be lower than calculated,

| leading to an increased MVA requirement to that tabulated. Detailed
design characteristics are not available, and so the estimates have been
made on this basis.

Table 12. Note that the 500 km/h individual breakdown is from deduced

Total active and complex power inputs to the machine are shown
in Table 13. The increased losses are scaled froma 1.6 MW loss
on the steady state 400 km/h baseline. Power factor estimates are

6. Analysis of Final Figures
. . 6.1 Common Points. .
It must be emphasized that the values obtained are modified from
the published speed extrapolations for short and long stator EMS designs
| -17 -

by assumptions of efficiency and power factor. For the EDS systen,
however, the 400 km/h extrapolation is obtained by reworking the
990 km/h values, and this does not represent a re-optimised system.

Inclusion of a residual acceleration of 0.013g into EDS figures
brings the accelerating mode of operation in line with that of the
EMS studies.

The short stator EMS design has no estimate for the distribution
loss in the 4 kV D.C. line, or current pickup loss or on board inverter
loss. A typical line copper loss (equivalent to voltage regulation)
might be 15%, which represents a 2.2 MW increase on just the 12.5 MW
active power load drawn by a 400 km/h accelerating LIM. Overall
power factor efficiency product of 0.51 for the short stator system
is evaluated, although 0.3 represents a more probable figure.

. Figures for the Tong stator EMS system must be regarded as
tentative, since the only linear testing has been on the 100 m_ track
at Kassel (Thyssen Henschel) and the 30 m track at Braunschweig,
at low speed..

6.2 Active Power Requirements.

The figures generated in the previous sections are displayed as
the active power requirements for each of the three Maglev systems
in Figure 6. The total values are broken down into their constituent
parts, Steady state (i.e. cruise) power is the sum of blocks 1-5 for
the EMS and 1, 2 and 5 for EDS. Including a residual acceleration
(block 6) incurs an additional loss (block 7), which added to the

steady state value gives the total accelerating active power requirement
shown at the top of each column.

It is immediately apparent that in terms of real power consumed
the long stator EMS and the EDS are roughly equivalent, when loaded,

at 500 km/h. The low efficiency short stator uses roughly 45%, the
high efficiency short stator roughly 11%, more active power (ignoring
~ dic. line loss). Including a 15% line loss the figures are 70% and
31% respectively.

At 400 km/h, using the unoptimised EDS as a base of 100%, the
equivalent long stator EMS figure is 80%, loaded, short stator EMS
114% and 88% (134% and 103% with 15% line loss).

Sat ee

Figure 7 expresses the active power requirement as a percentage
of the steady state, 500 km/h EDS value of 16.7 MW.
6.3 Reactive Power Requirements.

Table 14 shows total active, reactive and complex power of
the Maglev systems, for the four operating conditions. Figures which
include an allowance for the EMS D.C. rail loss estimated at 15%
complete the range of data.

Table 15 is a reworked version of Table 14, normalised by the
500 km/h steady state EDS values.

The most striking feature of Table 15 is the relative success
of the EDS system in using only small amounts of reactive power to
provide propulsion of the vehicle. As mentioned in Section 2.4 this
is mainly because the superconducting magnets provide the majority
of machine air gap field, and also because of the low per-unit reactance
of the air-cored long stator winding. The figures for steady state 500 km/h
operation of the long stator EMS machine are 21.2 MVAR, i.e. 241% that
of the EDS design. Roughly the same figure is obtained for the high
efficiency short stator EMS (247%), and inclusion of D.C. line brings the
figure up to 291%. The low efficiency short stator EMS figures are
476% and 561% respectively.

Table 16 is Table 14 reworked, normalised by the 400 km/h steady
state EDS values.

6.4 Complex Power Requirements

Figure 8 shows the total complex and active power requirements
of the Maglev systems. The power factor of the systems is simply
the abscissa to ordinate ratio for each of the operating conditions.
Since it is the complex power value that must be designed for and
for which system penalties will be incurred, the relative merits of
the three systems is demonstrated by the size of the ordinate. Ficure 9
displays just the total complex power requirements, in percentages
of the 500 km/h steady state EDS, for the four operating conditions.
The EMS long stator has 38% more, the high efficiency short stator
51% more than the EDS base, despite the rough equivalence of active
power used, Including line loss the short stator value
rises to a 78% increase. If the tower efficiency short stator EMS
is considered, then the figures become increases of 156%:.and 202% on
the EDS 100%.
7. Conclusions.
7.1 System Conclusions.

Because of the multiplicity of operating conditions, the systems
performance will be taken in turn, referenced to the values obtained
for 400 km/h (Table 16) and 500 km/h (Table 15), EDS steady state
service.

7.1.1. EMS Long Stator.

7.1.1.1. 400 km/h. Compares well with the EDS in. terms of active
power (69% EDS value) and complex power (88%). Uses, however, an
extra 45% more reactive power. When loaded, the advantages are
degraded, and needs an extra 51% more complex power compared to an
EDS requirement of an extra 34%.

’ 7.1.1.2. 500 km/h. Marginally better than one EDS in terms of active
power (90%) but uses 141% more reactive power, resulting in an extra
38% total complex power needed for steady state. Grade operation
requires an extra 116% more complex power, compared with an EDS 30%
requirement.
7.1.1.3 Power Factor and Efficiency. At the 400 km/h operating
condition, the apparent efficiency of the long stator motor is 0.57.

- 23-

Operation at grade or at 500 km/h, steady state, and at arade,
reduces this to 0.46, 0.44 and 0.36 (Table 17). As mentioned
in previous sections, this means that an excessive amount of complex
power 1s required for other than low speed cruise. Insufficient evidence
exists to confirm these values which are computed predictions. Only
very low speed testing on short linear tracks has been accomplished
(Section 6.1).

7.1.2.1 400 km/h. The high efficiency version compares well with the
EDS in terms of active power, and including a line loss the values
are virtually identical. However, uses 43% more complex power and
88% more (compared to 34% more) than the EDS, when leaded.
The low efficiency version is a lot worse; without including
a line loss, the complex power used is twice that of the EDS;
including a line loss, complex power is 141%.more than for steady
state, and 218% more when loaded, (compared to 34% for the loaded EDS).
- 24 -

7.1.2.2 500 km/n. As might be expected, the operation of the

linear induction motor at very high speed degrades its performance.
The increases in complex power required at steady state operation

for the high efficiency motor are 51%, and 78% including a line

loss. Loading the vehicle results in 90% and 123% increases compared
to 30% for the EDS.

A similar result for the low efficiency machine produces a
requirement of 156% and 202% increases at steady state, with and
without line loss, 221% and 277% compared to 30% for EDS when
loaded.
7.1.2.3 Power Factor and Efficiency. As mentioned in Section 4,3,

there is little performance data forthcoming about power factor
and efficiency and their product for multi-megawatt motors. It was
therefore decided to use the values of 0.6 and 0.78 for the
low and high efficiency machines respectively, with power factors of
0.5 and 0.65, resulting in products of 9.30 and 0.51,and to assume
that these values are load and speed invarient. In doing so it

| cannot be argued that particularly "bad" machines have been used
in the analysis and comparisons.
7.1.3. EDS Power Factor and Efficiency. A previous section (2.4)
has indicated that chosen power factor and efficiency values of the
EDS are energy and capital trade-offs rather than being inherently
limited. There is little change in apparent efficiency in going
from 500 to 400km/h (0.67 to 0.66, steady state, 0.62 to 0.60
loaded).
7.2 Overall Conclusions.

This study has attempted to establish total power requirements
for the three German Maglev vehicles operating under similar conditions.

The comparisons cannot be strictly rigorous, since the EMS and EDS
vehicles are primarily designed for different baseline operation.

. However, the spread of system total complex power, at. the trackside
substations, (Figs. 8,9), is indicative of the type of system performance
that might be expected for identical service conditions.

Several conclusions can be drawn from the dat studied, namely

- 25 -

(1} The EDS has good system performance at 500 and 400 km/h in

terms of energy conversion and power consumption,

(2) The short stator induction machines for the EMS are unsuitable

for high speed (500 km/h) operation, and are not very suited to

400 km/h operation, because of the high reactive power consumption

resulting in excessive overall power requirement. For example,

at 500 km/h, compared to the EDS machine on cruise, the higher

efficiency LIM studied required 1.8 times, and the lower efficiency

LIM, 3.0 times as much total complex power. At 400 km/h, the figures

are 1.4 and 2.4 times for the higher and lower efficiency LIMs studied,

respectively.

(3) The long stator motor EMS appears to need marginally less power

than the EDS at 400 km/h cruise (90% EDS value), but when loaded,

or at the higher speed of 500° km/h, this slight advantage is lost;

(loaded, 400 km/h, 1.13 times EDS value, 500 km/h, 1.4 times EDS

value cruise, 1.7 times EDS, loaded).

An additional shortcoming is that the machine concept has only

been tested at low speed, so high speed operating characteristics

must be tentative.

(4) In assessing system performance, using the value of specific

power (kW/tonne), lift to drag ratio or specific power consumption

(Wh/passenger-km) only indicates active power supplied to make up

thrust and (if included) losses in the system. Because of the low

power factors in some of the systems, trackside and transmission

components as well as Utility energy supply costing will be in

terms of total complex power used by a system. The MVA as well

as the MW requirements of a system must be obtained, related to

a common guideway route and similar baseline specifications before

a totally reasonable comparison can be made.
